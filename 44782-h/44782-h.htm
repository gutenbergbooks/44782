<h2 id='ch01' class='c005'><i>Chapter I</i><br /><br />AT THE BEACH CLUB</h2>

<p class='c006'>“Here he comes again, Dot!”</p>

<p>Terry Walters balanced on the edge of
the beach club float and pointed upward
toward the approaching airplane.</p>

<p>Dorothy Dixon bobbed up beside the
raft, blew the water from her nose and
reached a long tanned arm for the young
man’s ankle.</p>

<p>“Here <em>you</em> come into the drink, you
mean!” she gurgled.</p>

<p>Terry yelped, lost balance, and recovering
desperately, dived over her head.
His departure rocked the float, so that Phil
Stanton’s lanky figure poised on the diving
board, lurched and fell awkwardly
into the water.</p>

<p>Betty Mayo, hugging her damp knees on
the middle of the float, shrieked her approval
of this double exploit.</p>

<p>“Swell work, Dorothy!” she laughed as
that young lady pulled herself aboard.
“You’ll catch it in a minute though!”</p>

<p>Dorothy stood up. Her scarlet bathing
cap flamed against the ash blue sky and
her wet suit clung to her slender form like
a sheath of black lacquer.</p>

<p>“Maybe!” Then, in quite a different
tone: “Goodness, Betty, he’s missing!”</p>

<p>Betty sprang to her feet. “You’re
crazy—” she retorted as she caught sight
of Phil and Terry knifing their way back
to the float. “Why’d you try to scare me?
Those boys are all right.”</p>

<p>But Dorothy was staring skyward.</p>

<p>“Not the boys! I mean the plane,
Betty. Over there beyond the club house.
His engine’s missing. Bet you an ice
cream cone he’ll have to land!”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” Betty flashed back. “I
don’t know a thing about airplanes, and I’ll
take your word for it. Ooh, Dorothy—do
you think he’ll hit the roof?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right—”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s over the roof now—but <em>look</em>!”
Betty’s voice rose to a shriek. “He’s aiming
the plane straight for us—it’ll hit this
float—”</p>

<p>The last word was no more than a
gurgle. Betty had dived overside.</p>

<p>Dorothy did not trouble to turn her
head. With her bare feet firmly planted
on the timbers, her straight body balanced
easily to the float’s gentle rocking, she
gazed interestedly at the big amphibian
sweeping down toward her.</p>

<p>On came the plane, losing altitude with
every split second, and sailed over her head
a bare thirty feet above the water. Then
as she faced about to watch it land, the
tail of her eye caught sight of Terry hauling
himself over the edge of the float.</p>

<p>“Get you for that last one!” he cried,
and scrambled to his feet. “‘Who laughs
last,’ you know!”</p>

<p>“I know—” mocked Dorothy, evading
his grasp and running up the springboard.
She dived and her body entered the water
with scarcely a sound.</p>

<p>As she rose she turned lazily on her
back.</p>

<p>“Come and get me!” she tantalized.
Then as she saw him start in pursuit, she
rolled over and headed out toward the seaplane
which now floated two or three hundred
yards away toward the mouth of the
inlet and Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>Terry knew the speed developed by her
flagrantly perfect crawl, and did not attempt
to follow her. He chuckled as he
watched the bob of scarlet and the flash
of a brown arm that was all he could see
of Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Hey, where’s Dorothy?” called Betty
as she and Phil clambered on to the raft.</p>

<p>“Halfway to Boston, I guess. Race you
to the beach for the cones!”</p>

<p>All three cut the rumpled surface of the
water with a single splash.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s interest in the airplane that
had just landed was twofold. Since qualifying
for her private pilot’s license earlier
in the summer, she had met most of the
owners of planes living in or near New
Canaan. To the best of her knowledge the
Loening Amphibian which her father had
given her for rounding up the Martinelli
gang was the only one of that model privately
owned in that part of Connecticut.
That the plane lying just ahead on the
water was a duplicate of her own meant
that the owner was not a local person.</p>

<p>Dorothy was a keen aviatrix and proud
of her airbus. She wanted to compare
notes with the owner of this amphibian.
She was also curious to learn where the
plane came from; and why every day for
the past few weeks it had appeared over
the Club at about this same time of an afternoon.
At five-thirty sharp the crowd of
young people on the beach would see it,
a speck in the north, coming from over
the ridge country back of the Sound. Flying
at an altitude of not more than five
hundred feet, it would swing over the
beach club and cross the Sound, to disappear
in the ether toward the dim line of
the Long Island shore.</p>

<p>Terry jokingly termed it the Mystery
Plane. He told Dorothy that its owner
made these daily flights in order to show
her how a plane should be managed in
the air. She usually returned his good-natured
teasing with interest, but each
time she saw the amphibian, her curiosity
increased.</p>

<p>As she swam nearer it was plain that this
airship was actually the same stock model
as her own. With the retractible landing
wheels drawn up, the spoon-shaped hull
of the biplane, with its two open cockpits
aft of the inverted engine, floated easily on
the water. The aviator, she saw, was busily
engaged in going over his engine.</p>

<p>Dorothy stopped swimming when she
was a few yards from the amphibian.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” she called, treading
water. “Need any help?”</p>

<p>The man looked up from his work, evidently
perceiving her for the first time.
Dorothy was surprised to see that the face
below the soft helmet and goggles was
bearded to the eyes.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” he answered and went
on tinkering with the motor. The words,
although courteous enough, were spoken
in a tone that showed plainly that he wished
to end the conversation then and there.</p>

<p>Dorothy was persistent and not easily
discouraged.</p>

<p>“Located the trouble?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied the man without lifting
his head.</p>

<p>“Looks like loose manifold, or gas connection,
to me.”</p>

<p>There was no reply to this helpful suggestion.</p>

<p>She began swimming toward the plane
again.</p>

<p>“Mind if I come aboard?” she called.</p>

<p>The bearded aviator straightened his
back and faced her again, his right hand
grasping a monkey-wrench.</p>

<p>“No. I do not wish it,” he flared. “Why
for do you bother me? Keep off, I tell
you.”</p>

<p>For the first time, the girl in the water
noticed his strong foreign accent.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you polite!” she mocked. “I
don’t suppose you’ll mind if I come alongside
and rest a moment?”</p>

<p>“You stay where you are, young
woman.” As the man’s anger grew, his
accent became stronger. “I haf no time
to bodder wid you. Go away—and stop
away!”</p>

<p>“But I just want—”</p>

<p>“I don’t care <em>what</em> you want. Come
alongside, and I’ll use this wrench on
you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no you won’t!”</p>

<p>Terry Walters slipped round the engine
and tripped up the aviator. Before that
irate person knew what was happening he
found himself flat on his back with a hundred
and sixty pounds of young American
kneeling on his chest, menacing him with
his own monkey-wrench.</p>

<p>“That’s not a nice way to talk to a lady!”
Terry remarked dispassionately eyeing his
victim. “Ask her pardon like a good little
boy. Do it quickly, my friend, or I’ll plant
this wrench in the middle of that bush you
call a face!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean nossing,” the man
grunted.</p>

<p>“Try again!” Terry whacked his captive’s
shin with the wrench. “Also try to
cut the double negatives. Our English
teacher says they’re bad form and—”</p>

<p>Terry’s banter stopped with a yelp of
pain as the man’s head jerked upward and
his teeth snapped on the hand which held
the wrench.</p>

<p>Dorothy, who had swum to within a few
feet of the amphibian, saw Terry thrown
to one side. Like cats, the boy and the
man seemed to land on their feet—but now
it was the strange aviator who held the
monkey-wrench.</p>

<p>“Look out, Terry!” shrieked the girl as
she saw the man’s arm swing upward.</p>

<p>The small deck forward of the lower
wing section was far too narrow to permit
dodging. Terry did the only thing possible
under the circumstances to save himself.
Three seasons on the football team
of the New Canaan High had made that
young man a quick thinker. He dove below
the swinging blow and tackled the
aviator just above his knees. It was a well
aimed tackle and the two went hurtling
overside to disappear with a splash.</p>

<p>Terry’s blond head was the first to appear.
Then as the aviator’s came popping
up, facing the other way, young Walters
seized him by the shoulders and sent him
under once more.</p>

<p>“Let the man alone, Terry!” commanded
Dorothy. “Can’t you see he’s
swallowed half the Sound?”</p>

<p>“But he’d have brained me with that
wrench, Dot—”</p>

<p>“I’ll ‘Dot’ you if you take liberties with
my first name!” Miss Dixon shook her
fist above her head, “Anyway, it’s my
fault. I butted in. That man and his
plane are none of our business.”</p>

<p>They were swimming back toward the
float now and a glance over her shoulder
told Dorothy that their late antagonist was
pulling himself aboard the amphibian.</p>

<p>Terry saw him too, and waved a hand.
But the foreigner, occupied in wringing
water out of his clothes, disregarded them.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of the water for one
day,” declared Dorothy between strokes.
“How’s the wrist? You might have been
badly hurt, Terry.”</p>

<p>Terry motioned toward the float. “But
I wasn’t, old thing,” he chuckled. “Come
over to the raft a moment, before we go
ashore. I’ve got something I want to show
you.”</p>

<p>“Make it snappy, then,” she rejoined.
“You and I have got to be at Silvermine
by seven-thirty, you know. Curtain up at
eight-thirty—and you remember what Mr.
Watkins said about any of the cast being
late?”</p>

<p>Terry swung himself up on the decking
and gave a hand to Dorothy.</p>

<p>“I’m only a chorus man,” he grinned.
“We’ll both get to the Sillies in time. Look
at this—”</p>

<p>He opened his hand and held it out,
palm upward.</p>

<p>“I’m not interested in seaweed!” Dorothy’s
tone was full of disgust.</p>

<p>“Seaweed, nothing! That’s a piece of
your friend’s beard!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me you pulled
it out?”</p>

<p>“Not out, dearie—off. That wasn’t his
own hair that lad was wearing.”</p>

<p>“A <em>false beard</em>?”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>Dorothy pursed her lips. “Well, that
amphibian and its pilot are two of the most
mysterious things I’ve ever run into.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he is up to, Dot—I
mean, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“I wonder, too. By the way, how did
you happen out there—and just at the right
minute? I thought I saw you start a race
for the beach with Betty and Phil?”</p>

<p>Terry nodded his wet head and laughed.
“That was only a bluff to make you think I
wasn’t coming after you. As I saw you
were having an argument with him, and
I didn’t like the way he was acting, I swam
around the tail of his plane and got aboard
on the farther deck—and—well, you know
the rest. Why did you want to go aboard?”</p>

<p>“Curiosity, pure and simple. Have you
any idea why he flies over the Club nearly
every afternoon, and always at the same
time?”</p>

<p>“No—have you?”</p>

<p>“Not the dimmest. But now that I know
friend pilot wears false whiskers, I’m certainly
intrigued.”</p>

<p>“Come again,” frowned Terry. “I didn’t
get that last one. Did you say <em>intrigued</em>?”</p>

<p>“Cut the clowning. This is serious,
Terry. That fellow is up to some mischief,
or he wouldn’t disguise himself.”</p>

<p>Behind them the amphibian’s engine
sputtered, then roared.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” said Terry as the two
watched the plane taxi out toward the takeoff.
“Why don’t you get your bus and
follow that bird some afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I’d already decided to do it tomorrow.
Want to come?”</p>

<p>“You bet! How do you expect to work
it?”</p>

<p>“Look here, if we’re going to make that
show on time, we’d better go right now.
We’ll make our plans later. Come along.”</p>

<p>Their bodies cut the water with hardly
a splash as they raced for the beach. Out
in the inlet the amphibian rose gracefully
into the air and headed into the mist which
was creeping up Long Island Sound.</p>

<h2 id='ch02' class='c007'><i>Chapter II</i><br /><br />THE THREE RED LAMPS</h2>

<p class='c006'>In the wooded valley of the Silvermine,
some three miles from the village of New
Canaan, lies the famous artists’ colony
which bears the name of that rippling little
river. In the midst of this interesting community,
the artists have built their Guild
House, where exhibitions of paintings and
sculpture are held. And here it is that once
a year they give that delightful entertainment
known as the Silvermine Sillies.</p>

<p>The casts of the Sillies invariably comprise
the pick of local talent from the two
communities. Dorothy had starred in the
musical show given by the New Canaan
High School the previous winter. She
had a lovely voice and a natural talent for
acting. She loved amateur theatricals.
But that she should have been assigned a
part in the Sillies while yet in High School
was a compliment beyond her expectations.
She had worked hard at rehearsals
and under an assumed calm was wildly
excited on this, the opening night of the
show.</p>

<p>She left Terry on the beach, after cautioning
that young man again not to be
late, and ran up the shingle to the Dixons’
cabana, which, together with its gaily
painted counterparts, flanked the long club
house at the top of the beach.</p>

<p>A surprisingly few minutes later, Dorothy
reappeared, her bathing suit having
been discarded for an attractive linen
sports frock, and jumped into her car.</p>

<p>The distance between Tokeneke on
Long Island Sound and New Canaan back
in the hills of the Ridge Country is slightly
under eight miles. Luckily, on her drive
home, Dorothy encountered no traffic
policemen. Not withstanding summer
traffic and the narrow, winding roads, she
pulled into the Dixon garage on the ridge
a mile beyond the village, a bare ten minutes
later.</p>

<p>Another change of costume and she ran
downstairs to the dining room. Her father
and a friend were about to sit down at the
table.</p>

<p>“Sorry to be late, Daddy,” she apologized,
slipping into her chair. “Good evening,
Mr. Holloway.”</p>

<p>“Good evening, Miss Dorothy,” returned
the gentleman with a smile. “You
seem a bit blown.”</p>

<p>“Some rush!” she sighed, “but I made
it!”</p>

<p>“Youth,” remarked her father, “is nothing
if not inconsistent. We dine early, so
that Dorothy can get to the Sillies at some
unearthly hour, and—”</p>

<p>His daughter interrupted.</p>

<p>“Please, Daddy. I had an awfully exciting
experience this afternoon. I’d have
been home in plenty of time, otherwise.”</p>

<p>“At the Beach Club?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you tell us the story, as
penance.” He turned to his guest. “How
about it, Holloway? This should interest
you, one of the club’s most prominent
swimming fans!”</p>

<p>Mr. Holloway nodded genially. He
was older than Mr. Dixon, between fifty
and sixty, tall and rather thin. He had the
brow and jaw of a fighter, and his iron-grey
side-whiskers gave him a rather formidable
appearance. But Dorothy liked
him, for his eyes, behind his horn-rimmed
spectacles, beamed with friendliness.</p>

<p>“The Beach Club, eh?” He leaned
back in his chair. “Yes, I take a dip most
afternoons. Wonderful bracer after
mornings in the city in this hot weather. You
ought to get down there more often.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a pool at the Country
Club, and I’d rather play golf,” argued his
host. “I haven’t been to the Beach Club
this summer, but Dorothy tells me that the
cabana you’ve built is quite a palace—much
larger and more ‘spiffy,’ I think was
the word, than those we ordinary members
rent!”</p>

<p>“I like to be comfortable and have some
privacy when I entertain my friends down
there,” Mr. Holloway admitted. “But
I’m interested in hearing Dorothy’s story.
I was there this afternoon, but I didn’t
notice anything unusual.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the airplane that landed in
the cove?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. What time was that?”</p>

<p>“A little after five-fifteen.”</p>

<p>“I had already left for home. I’m rarely
at the club after five o’clock. I like a
bright sun when I’m in the water. What
about the plane?”</p>

<p>While Dorothy told of her experience
with the bearded pilot, the two gentlemen
continued their meal in silence.</p>

<p>“A nasty customer—that!” snapped her
father when she had concluded. “But
then, my dear, you shouldn’t allow your
keenness for aviation to over-excite your
curiosity. Let it be a lesson to you not to
interfere with other people’s private business.”</p>

<p>“You say that he wore a false beard?”
interjected Mr. Holloway. “Now I
wonder why the man wants to disguise himself?
And why he was so standoffish about
his plane?”</p>

<p>“He’s probably in training for some test
or endurance flight and wants to keep his
identity secret for the time being,” suggested
Mr. Dixon. “There’s often a lot of
hush-hush stuff about such things—that is,
until the stunt comes off—and then the
secretive ones become the world’s worst
publicity hounds!”</p>

<p>Dorothy remarked the change that came
to their guest’s face: the eyes narrowed, the
mouth grew harder; something of his levity
disappeared.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he said slowly. “But whatever
his reason for wishing privacy, we
can’t have club members insulted by
strange aviators in our own cove. I shall
take it up at the board of governors’ meeting
tomorrow. In future we will see to it
that no more airplanes land on club waters.
Do you think you would recognize the
man without his beard, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so—but Terry, who was
nearer to him, swears he could spot him
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“If he should do so, ask him to report
the matter to me, and I’ll see that the man
at least offers apology.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Holloway.” Dorothy
was pleased at this interest. “I’ll tell him.”</p>

<p>“You three had better leave well enough
alone,” her father declared bluntly. “The
plane is probably being flown over a set
course which happens to take it over the
club. That aviator seems to be a surly
customer. My advice is to forget it....”</p>

<p>Dorothy pushed her chair back from
the table.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse me, won’t you?” she
smiled. “I’ve got to run, now.” She went
to her father and kissed him. “Please don’t
be late, Daddy. I come on the first time
right after the curtain rises—it will spoil
my evening if you two aren’t there!”</p>

<p>Mr. Holloway’s kindly eyes twinkled behind
his glasses.</p>

<p>“Nice of you to include me. I wouldn’t
miss the first number for anything. I’ll
see that we’re both there in time.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, sweetheart.” Her father
patted her hand. “We’ve got a small matter
of business to go over and then we’ll
be right along. Success to you, dearest.”</p>

<p>“’Bye!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p>A fine rain was falling when Dorothy
stepped into her car. As yet it was more
a heavy mist than a downpour. But with
the wind in the east she realized that this
part of the country was in for several days
of wet weather. She drove carefully, for
the winding wooded roads were slippery.
Upon arriving at the Guild House, she
changed at once into costume.</p>

<p>The Silvermine Sillies, like Mr. Ziegfield’s
more elaborate Follies, is invariably
a revue, consisting of eighteen or twenty
separate acts. As Dorothy stood in the
wings, waiting for her cue, shortly after
the first curtain rose, she was addressed by
the stage manager:</p>

<p>“Have you seen Terry?”</p>

<p>“Not since this afternoon. Why?”</p>

<p>“He’s not here.”</p>

<p>Dorothy was fighting back the stage
fright that always assailed her while waiting
to “go on,” but which always disappeared
as soon as she made her entrance.
She turned her mind to what the manager
was saying with an effort.</p>

<p>“You mean he hasn’t shown up?” she
asked a bit vacantly.</p>

<p>“Your perception is remarkable,” returned
the harassed stage official with pardonable
sarcasm. “No, Terry isn’t here.
Do you know whether he had any intention
of putting in an appearance at this
show tonight when you last saw him?”</p>

<p>Dorothy was wide awake now. “Of
course he had!”</p>

<p>“He didn’t mention some more important
date, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Terry wouldn’t do such
a thing!”</p>

<p>“Well, he goes on in less than two minutes.
Who in blazes am I to get to double
for him? Deliver me from amateurs!
There’s your cue, Miss Dixon—better take
it!”</p>

<p>“Hey, you, Bill!” she heard him call to a
stage hand, as she made her entrance.
“Duck into the men’s dressing room and
bring me Terry Walters’ overalls and wig.
Here’s where I do his stuff without a makeup!”</p>

<p>Terry failed to show up during the first
part of the program, so during the intermission,
Dorothy slipped out front and
sought the delinquent’s father and mother
in the audience.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, I’m quite as surprised
as you are,” gurgled Mrs. Walters. “Isn’t
this rain disgusting? You looked perfectly
lovely Dorothy—and you did splendidly,
splendidly, my dear. I thought I’d
die when your rope of pearls broke and
you went hunting for them—a perfect
scream, my dear—the funniest thing in the
show!”</p>

<p>“Those were Betty Mayo’s pearls,” said
Dorothy. “I wasn’t in that act. You say
Terry left the house in plenty of time, and
he expected to drive straight down here?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Walters had said nothing of the
kind, but Dorothy had known the lady for
years, and had long ago devised a method
of securing information from her.</p>

<p>“He didn’t even wait for dessert, my
dear. He probably went to the movies or
remembered some other date. Boys are
like that!”</p>

<p>“Terry isn’t.” His father spoke up.
“He must have been going to pick someone
up and give them a lift down here—then
blew a shoe or something. Still, I
don’t like it. I hope the boy hasn’t met
with an accident.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, Reggie! You make
me feel positively faint. I know he has
gone to the pictures.” Mrs. Walters was
nervously emphatic. “Don’t be so silly,
dear—I know he has.”</p>

<p>“You know nothing of the kind,” declared
her husband.</p>

<p>“But, Reggie dear—”</p>

<p>Dorothy hurriedly excused herself and
went back stage.</p>

<p>But by the time the final curtain was
rung down, no Terry had appeared.
Dorothy was really worried. Betty was
giving a party to a number of the cast at her
house in White Oak Shade, but despite
protests, Dorothy made her regrets and
went to look for her father.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll beat it for home, Dad,” she
announced, buttonholing him near the
door.</p>

<p>“I’ll be along in a few minutes, darling.
I certainly am more than extra proud of
you tonight. I never realized what an actress
you are. But you look troubled—anything
the matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m worried about Terry. I know he
wouldn’t deliberately put us all in this hole.
He’s not that kind.”</p>

<p>“Probably had a break-down,” consoled
her father. “Excuse me, dear, I want to
speak to the Joneses over there.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p>Dorothy drove a six-cylinder coupe
whose body had seen better days, though
she claimed for its engine that the world
had not seen its equal. With her windiper
working furiously, she came
cautiously along Valley Road, her big
headlamps staring whitely ahead. The
rain was pelting down now, and since she
must have a window open, and that window
was on the weather side, one arm and
part of the shoulder of her thin slicker were
soon black and shining.</p>

<p>“Something he couldn’t help—that’s
what made Terry let us down,” said her
subconscious mind, and she wondered how
any of the cast could have expressed contrary
opinions. She was glad she had refused
Betty’s invitation. She liked Terry
and was deeply concerned about him. He
wasn’t the sort to default unless something
unforeseen and unusual occurred. Mrs.
Walters said he had been full of the show
at dinner and had spoken about getting to
the Guild House early. Something had
come up, that was certain. And that something,
after he had started for Silvermine in
his car. The more she thought about it,
the more mysterious it seemed. She would
phone the Walters again as soon as she
reached home. Maybe he would be back
by that time.</p>

<p>The car skidded round the turn into the
Ridge Road that ran past the Dixon place.
A mile farther on, Dorothy decided it
would be well for her to keep her mind on
the road ahead. A few minutes before, a
lumbering truck had almost driven her into
the ditch, and now, with a mile to go,
she saw ahead of her three red lights. She
slowed her engine until she came within
a dozen yards of them.</p>

<p>They were red lamps, placed in a line
across the road, and if they meant anything,
it was that the road was under repair and
closed. Yet she had passed the truck going
at full speed just beyond the corner.
From its lights, she was sure it had come
along this stretch of road.</p>

<p>She peered through the open window
and saw on her left a dilapidated stone
fence, the top of which was hidden under
a blanket of wild honeysuckle. She saw
by her headlights a gap where once she
knew a five-barred gate had blocked the
way to the open field. All this she took in
at a glance, for Dorothy knew exactly
where she was. Then she turned again to
her scrutiny of the road and the three red
lamps.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Dorothy to herself. She
switched out all the lights of the car, and
taking something from her pocket, she
opened the door quietly and stepped into
the rain. She stood there for a while, listening.</p>

<p>There was no sound except the swish and
patter of the storm. Keeping to the centre
of the road she advanced slowly toward the
red lights, picked up the middle one and
examined it. The lantern was old—the red
had been painted on the glass. The second
lantern was newer, but of entirely different
pattern. Here also, the glass pane had
been covered by some red, transparent
paint. And this was the case with the third
lamp.</p>

<p>Dorothy threw the middle light into the
ditch and found satisfaction in hearing the
crash of glass. Then she came back to her
car, got inside, slammed the door and put
her foot down on the starter. The motor
whined but the engine did not move. The
car was hot and never before had it failed.
Again she tried, but without success.</p>

<p>“This looks suspicious,” she muttered to
herself.</p>

<p>She sprang out into the rain again and
walked to the back to examine her gasoline
tank. There was no need, for the indicator
said, “Empty.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say suspicious!” she muttered
again, angrily, as she stared down at the
cause of her plight.</p>

<p>She had filled up just before dinner, but
notwithstanding that fact, here was a trustworthy
indicator pointing grimly to “E”;
and when she tapped the tank, it gave forth
a hollow sound in confirmation.</p>

<p>Dorothy sniffed: the air reeked with
fumes. Flashing her pocket light on the
ground she saw a metal cap and picked it
up. Then she understood what had happened.
The roadway, under her light,
gleamed with opalescent streaks. Someone
had taken out the cap and emptied her
tank while she was examining the red
lamps!</p>

<p>She refastened the cap, which was airproof,
waterproof, and foolproof, and
which could only have been turned by the
aid of a spanner—she had heard no chink
of metal against metal. She did not carry
reserve fuel, but home was not more than
a mile down the road, round the turn. And
she knew there was a path from the gap
in the stone wall, across the field and
through a belt of woods that would halve
the distance.</p>

<p>She sent her flashlight in the direction
of the open gateway. One of the posts
was broken and the rotting structure
leaned drunkenly against a lilac bush. In
the shadow behind the bush, she was certain
that a dark form moved.</p>

<p>Dorothy lingered no longer, but switching
off her light, she turned on her heel
and raced up the road.</p>

<h2 id='ch03' class='c007'><i>Chapter III</i><br /><br />WHERE’S TERRY?</h2>

<p class='c006'>Behind her, Dorothy heard a shout, and
that shout lent wings to her feet. Scared
as she was, she grinned. For she was probably
doing the only thing her would-be assailants
had not counted on. She was running
away from the red lights and home,
sprinting down the road the way she had
come. Overhead, tall elms met in an archway,
and from the darkness at her back
came the quick patter of footsteps. Suddenly
they stopped.</p>

<p>Dorothy gave a sigh of joyous relief, for
around the bend in the road she saw the
double gleam of headlights, shining
through the wet. Stopping short in the
middle of the road, she switched on her
flashlight again and waved it frantically
from side to side.</p>

<p>“Daddy!” she cried as the big car drew
up. “I was sure you weren’t far away.
Gee! but I was glad to see your lights.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon snapped open the door and
Dorothy slipped in beside him.</p>

<p>“Why, what are you doing out here?
Have a breakdown?”</p>

<p>“H-holdup,” she panted. “My car’s
down the road. Step on it, Dad—maybe
we can catch them.”</p>

<p>“An ounce of discretion is sometimes
worth forty pounds of valor,” he began,
throwing in the clutch.</p>

<p>Dorothy cut him short. “Look!” she
cried excitedly, and for all Mr. Dixon’s
cautious announcement, the car jumped
forward with a jerk. “See, Daddy! There’s
my tail light! They’ve turned it on again.
And the red lights have disappeared.”</p>

<p>“What red lights?”</p>

<p>“Tell you in a minute. Better slow
down. My car’s out of gas. I’ve got a
piece of hose in the rumble. We can siphon
enough from your tank into mine to get
me home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon brought his car to a stop directly
behind Dorothy’s coupe.</p>

<p>“Before we do anything, I want to hear
exactly what happened, dear. You scared
your fond parent out of a year’s growth
when I caught sight of you waving that
light in the middle of the road!”</p>

<p>“Poor old Daddy.” She threw an arm
about his neck. “You weren’t half as
frightened as I was. Those men were pelting
down the road behind me and—”</p>

<p>Her father broke in. “Well, they seem
to have disappeared now. Let me hear the
beginning.”</p>

<p>In a few short sentences, Dorothy told
him.</p>

<p>“So you see,” she ended. “There’s nothing
more for us to do about it, I guess, except
to put some gas in my tank, and go
home.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Hand over that flash,
please.” He opened the door and with
an agility surprising in so large a man,
sprang into the wet road and ran toward
the gap in the wall.</p>

<p>As he ran, Dorothy saw a light flash in
his hand. Then he went out of sight behind
the wall but she could still see the
gleam through the bushes. Presently he
came back to where she was standing beside
the car.</p>

<p>“Vamoosed!” He tossed the flash onto
the seat. “As there’s no car on the road
ahead they must have beat it over the field.
I wonder why they didn’t hold you up when
you’d stopped for those red lanterns?
Strange. Also, why do you suppose they
switched on your lights?”</p>

<p>“It’s beyond me. Well, Daddy, if you’ll
pull alongside we’ll siphon the gas. This
place and the rain and everything gives me
the shivers. Let’s talk it over when we get
home.”</p>

<p>Soon they were under way, and they continued
on to the Dixon place without further
incident.</p>

<p>“Your shoes are soaking wet, Dorothy.
Go up to your room and change them, my
dear,” decreed her father. “While you’re
doing that, I’ll phone Walters.”</p>

<p>When Dorothy came downstairs her
father was in the living room.</p>

<p>“Come over here and sit down,” he said,
making room for her on the lounge beside
him. “Terry has not come home yet. The
family pretend not to be worried—and
that’s that. I said nothing about what happened
to you on your way back from Silvermine.”</p>

<p>His daughter groaned. “Oh dear—if
we could only figure out—but those three
red lights seem to cinch things, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Hardly that. But they do make it look
as though this disappearing business is
pretty serious—”</p>

<p>Dorothy interrupted him eagerly:
“Then there isn’t any doubt in your mind
but that our experience at the club this afternoon
is accountable for Terry’s disappearance,
and my holdup?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon, who was filling his pipe,
struck a match and puffed contemplatively.</p>

<p>“We can’t jump at conclusions, my dear.
My first idea about that plane may be the
right one. On the other hand, this business
tonight certainly forces one’s suspicions.
If Terry doesn’t show up by morning,
we’ll turn the matter over to the police
and start a thorough search. But I do
think it wise to keep the story of the amphibian
and its pilot to ourselves.”</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded. “You mean that if we
spread our suspicions to the police, they’d
let the cat out of the bag and the man
would be on his guard?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it. And then you must remember
that we really have no facts to go
on as yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I’ll go to bed,” yawned
Dorothy. “Do you mind if I try to trail
that plane with my own?”</p>

<p>“Not if you’ll promise to be careful, dear.
In fact, I think it’s a good idea. But one
thing I must insist upon and that is—you’re
to keep me posted. No more of this
taking things into your own hands, as you
did with the Martinellis. It’s too dangerous.
Confide in your old Dad, girl, and
we’ll do a lot better.”</p>

<p>Dorothy was half way across the room,
but here she turned and ran back to her
father and kissed him. “Of course I’ll tell
you everything. Isn’t it too bad, though,
that Bill Bolton is away? He’d have been
a wonderful help. Have you any idea what
he is doing?”</p>

<p>“All I know is what his father told me—that
he’s off on some government job. It
may be Secret Service work, again. Anyway,
he’s to be away indefinitely, I understand.
Now, just one thing more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Daddy</em>! <em>More</em> instructions to
take care of myself?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon laughed at her outraged expression,
and relit his pipe.</p>

<p>“Not exactly—you seem to have the luck
to generally land on your feet. But, I want
you to consider this: if the bearded aviator
or his associates <em>are</em> behind Terry’s disappearance,
they kidnapped him because
they thought he would recognize the man.
And they tried to do the same thing to you
tonight.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth should they fear being
recognized?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the slightest idea. It depends
on what they’re up to. There must be a
strong motive behind it. You don’t strike
a match unless you want a light. But unless
we’re chasing moonbeams, something
illegal is going on and if there is a hunt for
Terry tomorrow, I don’t want you to take
part in it.”</p>

<p>“You think they’ll try to get me again?”</p>

<p>“It is highly possible.” Her father got
to his feet and put his hands on her shoulders.
“So promise me you won’t go running
about country byroads in your car, even
during daylight hours. If you must go
out at night, either I or Arthur must be in
the car with you.” (Arthur was the
Dixons’ chauffeur-gardener.) “There’s
no use trying to pretend I’m not worried
about this mysterious business. Be a good
girl and don’t make it harder for me,
please.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be good, Daddy. If I find out anything
tomorrow, I’ll report at dinner.”</p>

<p>“That’s my girl,” he beamed, and kissed
her good night. “I shall nose about, myself,
a bit. I’m sure that you and Terry
know that bearded aviator or some of his
friends. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so perturbed
about recognition. Unless we’re
all wet, Dorothy, this affair is made up of
local people. Mind your step—and we’ll
see. Go to bed now and get a good rest—I’m
coming upstairs as soon as I’ve locked
up.”</p>

<h2 id='ch04' class='c007'><i>Chapter IV</i><br /><br />THE THUNDERHEAD</h2>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy telephoned the Walters next
morning, to learn from a maid that Terry
was still missing, and that Mr. Walters was
down in the village, putting the matter in
the hands of the police.</p>

<p>“May I speak to Mrs. Walters?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, miss. Mrs. Walters has
been up all night. Doctor Brown has given
her a sleeping powder and issued orders
that she is not to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“If there is anything that I can do,” said
Dorothy, “telephone me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss. I’ll tell Mr. Walters
when he comes home.”</p>

<p>Dorothy rang off and went about her
household duties with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>Later on she motored to the village to
do her marketing, and upon her return
found that her father had telephoned. She
immediately called up the New Canaan
Bank, of which he was president.</p>

<p>“Any news, Daddy?” she inquired anxiously,
as soon as she was put through to
him.</p>

<p>“That you, Dorothy?” she heard him
say. “Yes—Terry’s car has been found.”</p>

<p>“<em>Where</em>, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“On a wood road in the hills back of the
Norwalk reservoir. The car was empty.
A farmer driving through there found it
early this morning and phoned the license
number to the police.”</p>

<p>“But what in the world could Terry have
been doing way over there? I know that
road. It’s no more than a bridle path—the
reservoir is three or four miles beyond Silvermine.”</p>

<p>“My opinion is that Terry was never
anywhere near the place,” explained her
father. “He was undoubtedly held up, removed
to another car and his own run over
to the spot where it was found.”</p>

<p>“No sign of him, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve talked with Walters. The
poor man is nearly off his head with worry.
We’re getting up searching parties to cooperate
with the police. I’ll see you at
dinner tonight. It will be impossible for
me to get home at noon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hope to have some news for you,
then,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Going up in spite of the rain?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to. We can’t afford to waste
time—the weather’s not so bad.”</p>

<p>“There are storm warnings out all along
the coast.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“All right. Bye-bye till dinner time.”</p>

<p>“Bye.”</p>

<p>She hung up the receiver and for the rest
of the morning, busied herself about the
house, determined not to let her mind dwell
upon the darker side of this latest development.
After lunch she changed into flying
clothes and went out to the hangar.</p>

<p>Unlocking the doors, she set to work filling
the amphibian’s gasoline tanks. Then
she went over the engine carefully and gave
it a short ground test. After that, the instruments
came under her inspection. Altogether,
she gave her plane a thorough
overhauling, which was not entirely necessary,
but kept her from thinking and
helped to kill time.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes to five she ran the
amphibian out of the hangar and took
off into the teeth of a fine rain. It was no
part of her plan to fly in the neighborhood
of the Beach Club until the plane she was
seeking should put in an appearance. Her
self-imposed duty was to spot the mysterious
amphibian and to follow it to its destination
without allowing the pilot or an
understudy to spot her.</p>

<p>So instead of banking and heading for
Tokeneke, when her bus had sufficiently
topped the trees, she continued to keep the
stick back so as to maintain a proper climbing
angle. Back in her first thirty hours
of early flight training, it would have been
difficult for her to keep <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
(more often termed Willie or Wispy) at
the correct angle safely below the stalling
point, unless she could first recognize that
angle by the position of the plane’s nose
relative to the horizon. On a wet day like
this with an obscured horizon it would
have been well-nigh impossible: at best, a
series of bad stalls would have been the
result. But now her snapping gray eyes
sparkled with exhilaration; she no longer
needed the horizon as a guide. Between
leveling off every thousand feet or so, to
keep the engine from overheating, she shot
<i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> up to six thousand, maintaining
the proper angle of climb by the
“feel” of the plane alone.</p>

<p>With her altimeter indicating the height
she wanted, she leveled off again; then,
executing a sharp reverse control or “flipper”
turn to the left she resumed straight
flight again by the application of up aileron
and opposite rudder. The plane was now
headed south, several points to the west of
the Beach Club.</p>

<p>The visibility was even poorer than at
a lower level, but the young pilot knew
this part of the country as she knew her own
front lawn. Either dropping or swerving
her plane’s nose at frequent intervals so as
to get an unimpeded view ahead, she passed
over the wooded ridges toward the shore,
over the city of Stamford and out over the
slate grey waters of Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>That body of water is some six or eight
miles wide at this point, and upon reaching
the opposite shore, Dorothy commenced a
patrol of the Long Island shore line from
Lloyds’ Neck, which lies just west of Oyster
Bay, to the farther side of Smithtown
Bay, a distance of fifteen or sixteen miles.
And as she flew, she kept a sharp lookout
for planes appearing out of the murk toward
the Connecticut shore.</p>

<p>Since she knew it was the bearded aviator’s
practice to fly at a comparatively low
altitude, Dorothy chose to keep <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
at this greater height for two reasons.
An airplane flying far above another
plane is much more unlikely to be noticed
by the pilot of the lower plane than one
flying at his own level or below him. Then
again, by keeping to the higher air,
Dorothy, under normal weather conditions,
was bound to increase her range of
vision proportionately. Her plan was a
good one. But weather is not a respecter
of plans. The visibility, poor enough when
she started, gradually grew worse and
worse. Although what wind there was
seemed to have died, long curling tongues
of mist crept out of the east, while above
her head she saw black thunder clouds,
sinking lower and lower.</p>

<p>Now one of the first things any aviator
learns is that fog must be avoided at all
costs. Any attempt to land in it is attended
by considerable danger. Dorothy knew
only too well that in case of a fog bank
cutting the plane off from its destination,
the flight must be discontinued by a landing,
or by return to the point of departure.</p>

<p>She glanced overside again. Long
Island Sound was no longer visible.</p>

<p>“He’s late now, unless I’ve missed him,”
she said to herself. “I’ll finish this leg of
the patrol and if he doesn’t show up by the
time I’m over Oyster Bay, <i>Willie</i> and I will
head for home.”</p>

<p>Pushing her stick slightly forward to decrease
her altitude, she continued along her
course.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, she realized her
mistake. The wisps of fog seemed to
gather together, and <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> sank
into an opaque bank that blinded her.</p>

<p>“Gee, but I’m stupid!” she mumbled.
“What was it that text-book I read only
yesterday said? ‘In the event of general
formation of fog below, an immediate landing
must be made before it becomes thick
enough to interfere seriously with the approach.’
Heavens, what a fool I am! Now
that we’re in it, though, I might as well see
if it thins out nearer the water.”</p>

<p>Her compass told her she was flying almost
due west. Throttling down the engine,
she pushed her stick still farther forward,
at the same time applying right aileron
and hard right rudder. As the proper
gliding angle was reached, she neutralized
her elevators and held the nose up as necessary.
Next, she checked her wing with the
ailerons and eased her rudder pressure.
Then having made a quarter-spiral with
a change in course of 90 degrees, she applied
left aileron and hard left rudder until
the wings were level laterally, and with her
stick still held forward, continued to descend
in a straight glide until she was within
fifteen hundred feet of the water. The
plane was heading directly back across
Long Island Sound toward the Connecticut
shore.</p>

<p>But each moment the fog seemed to grow
more dense. To land blindly meant a certain
nose-in and was out of the question.
And even if the mist did not hold to the
water’s level, to fly lower meant the chance
of striking the mast or spar of a ship, a
lighthouse, perhaps, or anything else that
came her way.</p>

<p>“We’re up against it, <i>Wispy</i>,” she murmured,
opening the throttle and pulling
back her stick. “If we can’t go down, at
least we can ‘go above,’ as they say in the
Navy. Beat it for the heavens, my dear.
This beastly fog can’t run all the way to
Mars!”</p>

<p>Dorothy was not frightened, although
she knew how serious was her predicament.
No pilot likes flying blind in a fog. With
the knowledge that what one sees, one hits,
it is a nerve-wracking experience.</p>

<p>But Dorothy’s nerves were good—none
better—and she sent her plane into a long,
steady climb, hoping for the best and keeping
her vivid imagination well within control.</p>

<p>Headed into the north, she continued
her climb, leveling off every few thousand
feet to ease the strain on her engine. When
the altimeter marked thirteen thousand she
began to worry, for the service ceiling of
her plane was but two thousand higher.
The cold damp of the thick mist penetrated
like a knife. Hemmed in by the dank grey
walls, she could barely distinguish the nose
of her ship. The active needles of the altimeter
and rate of climb indicator were the
only visible signs that <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
was moving at all.</p>

<p>Fourteen thousand feet—intense physical
discomfort, added to the nervous strain,
were becoming intolerable. Dorothy
clenched her chattering teeth in an effort
to retain her control. Then with a suddenness
astonishing, the fog parted and she
sailed into clear air.</p>

<p>Below her the heavy mist swirled and
rolled like a sluggish sea, grey-yellow
streaked with dirty streamers, while directly
ahead loomed a towering mass of
cotton-like clouds rising tier upon tier as
far as she would see.</p>

<p>A quick glance over her shoulder and
to the sides, brought forth the fact that this
small pocket of free air was entirely surrounded
by similar cloud formations.
There was no time for thought. Automatically,
her hand clasping the stick shot
forward, bringing down the nose to the
position of level flight, and she drove the
amphibian straight at the thunderhead.
Immediately afterward the plane passed
into the cloud, and like a leaf caught in an
inverted maelstrom, it was whipped out of
her control.</p>

<p>Gripped by tremendous air forces, the
amphibian was shot up and sideways, at
a speed that burned Dorothy’s lungs.
Tossed about like a rag doll, with her
safety-belt almost cutting her body in two,
she was thrown hither and yon with the
plane, blind, and without the slightest idea
as to her position.</p>

<p>Never in her wildest nightmares had she
dreamed that a heavy plane, weighing close
to four thousand pounds when empty,
could be tossed about in such fashion by
currents of the air.</p>

<p>For a space of time that seemed years,
she was entirely away from the controls.
But gradually, with infinite effort and in
spite of the whirling jolts of her air steed,
Dorothy managed to hook her heels under
the seat. A second later she had caught the
stick and was pushing it forward into the
instrument board.</p>

<p><i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> reared like an outlawed
bronco, then dived until the airspeed
indicator showed one hundred and sixty-five
miles per hour. Still her downward
speed was less than the rate of the upward
draft, for the rate of climb indicator told
the frenzied girl that the plane was being
lifted fourteen hundred feet per minute.</p>

<p>Still diving at 45 degrees, the phenomenal
force of the updraft carried the plane to
the mushroom top of the cloud, where with
a jar like an elevator hitting the ceiling, it
was flung forth into the outer air.</p>

<h2 id='ch05' class='c007'><i>Chapter V</i><br /><br />HIDE AND SEEK</h2>

<p class='c006'>The strong air current which spread
horizontally over the thunderhead blew
Dorothy’s plane sideways and away from
the cloud. An instant later it was roaring
downward in the thin air, quite beyond her
control, a self-propelled projectile rushing
to its doom.</p>

<p>While shooting upward in the cloud, the
violent and intensely rapid gyrations of the
airship caused her safety belt to become
unclasped, and had her parachute not
caught in the cowling, she must have been
flung clear of the plane to a horrible death
far below.</p>

<p>With her heels still hooked beneath the
pilot’s seat, she wrenched the parachute
loose. Then she closed the throttle and
half-suffocated by the force of the wind
and lack of breathable oxygen, she commenced
to pull the stick slowly backward.</p>

<p>A glance at the altimeter showed a
height of eighteen thousand feet—three air
miles above earth—and three thousand feet
above <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp’s</i> service ceiling.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the shut-off engine, the
speed of the diving plane was terrific.
Dorothy felt the grinding jar of the wind-strained
wings as the nose began to rise in
answer to the pull of the elevators; and
wondered helplessly if they would hold.</p>

<p>The air pressure was agony to her eardrums.
Her head reeled. She was well-nigh
exhausted. She no longer cared very
much what happened.</p>

<p>The plane dropped into a blanket of fog.
She felt the wet mist on her face, refreshing
and reanimating her. Suddenly she realized
that her parachute was starting to fill
and would shortly pull her out of the cockpit.
With her free hand she reached under
the seat and brought forth a sheath knife.
A frenzied second later she had rid herself
of the flapping bag. As it flew overboard,
she tightened her safety belt and placed her
cramped feet back on the steering pedals.</p>

<p>Though still fog-blind, she could at least
breathe comfortably now as the plane lessened
speed in descent. <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
still shook and groaned, but no longer
fought the pull of the stick. Up came the
nose, slowly but surely and with her ailerons
functioning once more, Dorothy
gained control and sent the plane into a
normal glide. The altimeter marked five
thousand feet. The dive had been over
two miles long.</p>

<p>Another fifteen hundred feet and gradually
the mist lightened until it became mere
wisps of smoky cloud. Long Island Sound
had been left behind. Below lay the wooded
hills and valleys of the Connecticut ridge
country, cloaked in multi-shaded green.
As she still headed north, Dorothy knew
now that she had been blown beyond New
Canaan. She gave the plane hard right
rudder and right aileron and sent it swinging
into a long half spiral, which, completed,
headed her south again. Almost directly
below, she recognized the Danbury
Fair Grounds, with home just twenty miles
away.</p>

<p>Again her hand sought the throttle and
as <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> snorted, then roared,
Dorothy breathed a thankful sigh. Fifteen
minutes later she had housed her plane
in its hangar, and was limping up the
porch steps of her home.</p>

<p>Lizzie, the Dixons’ servant, met her in
the hall.</p>

<p>“Whatever is the matter, Miss Dorothy?
You’ve had an accident—you’re half-killed—I
know you are! There’s blood all over
your face—”</p>

<p>Her young mistress interrupted, smiling:</p>

<p>“You’re wrong again, Lizzie. No accident,
though I know I look pretty awful.
I feel that way, too, if you ask me—”</p>

<p>“But the blood, Miss Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“It’s from a nosebleed, Lizzie. I assure
you I’m not badly hurt. If you’ll help me
out of these rags and start a warm bath
running, I’ll be ever so much obliged. A
good soaking in hot water will fix me up.
Then,” she added, “I think I’ll be real luxurious
and have my dinner in bed.”</p>

<p>When the solicitous Lizzie brought up
the dinner tray three-quarters of an hour
later, a tired but decidedly sprucer
Dorothy, in pink silk pyjamas, was leaning
back against her pillows.</p>

<p>“My word, I’m hungry!” She seized a
hot roll and began to butter it. “I’m off
bucking thunderheads for life, Lizzie.
But you can take it from me, that kind of
thing gives you a marvelous appetite!”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, I’m glad,” returned Lizzie,
who had no idea what Dorothy was talking
about. “You certainly look better.”</p>

<p>“By the way, what’s become of Daddy?
Hasn’t he got home yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Dorothy, I’m so sorry. Sure
and I forgot to tell ye—Mr. Dixon won’t
be home for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Did he telephone?”</p>

<p>“No, miss. He came home about quarter
to five and packed his suitcase. He said
to tell you he’d been called to Washington
on business and he’d be gone a couple of
days. Arthur drove him to Stamford to
catch the New York express—he didn’t
have much time.”</p>

<p>Dorothy helped herself to a spoonful of
jellied bouillon. “Any other message?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. He said that Mister Terry
hadn’t been found yet. I asked him b’cause
I thought you’d like to know. That was
all he said. I’m sure sorry I forgot it when
you came in, but I—”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Lizzie, I understand.
You come back for the tray in half an hour,
will you? And if you find me asleep, don’t
wake me up. I’m tired to death. I need
a long rest and I’m going to take it.”</p>

<p>When Lizzie came back she found
Dorothy deep in the sleep of exhaustion.
She lowered the window blinds against the
early morning light and picking up the
tray from the end of the bed, tiptoed from
the room.</p>

<p>Morning broke bright and clear with
no sign of yesterday’s mist and rain.
Dorothy remained in bed for breakfast and
it took but little persuasion on the part of
Lizzie to keep her there till lunch time.
She still felt stiff and bruised and was only
too content to rest and doze.</p>

<p>Toward noon she rose and dressed in
her flying clothes. Immediately after
lunch she went out to the hangar. She
slipped into a serviceable and grubby pair
of overalls, and spent the afternoon in giving
<i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> a thorough grooming.
At quarter to five she was in the air
and headed for Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, with an altitude of
ten thousand feet, she was cruising over
yesterday’s course above the Long Island
shore, when she spied a biplane coming
across the Sound. In an instant she had her
field glasses out and focussed on the newcomer.</p>

<p>“That’s him!” she murmured ungrammatically,
though with evident relief.
“Now for a pleasant little game of hide-and-seek!”</p>

<p>The <i>Mystery Plane</i> was flying far below,
so continuing on her course at right
angles, she watched it with hurried glances
over her shoulder. When she reached the
Long Island Shore line, it was a mile or so
behind and below Dorothy’s tailplane. So
waiting only long enough to be sure that
her quarry was headed across the Island,
she banked her plane and sent it on a wide
half circle to the right. Long Island, at
this point, she knew was about twenty
miles wide.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s plan for trailing the <i>Mystery
Plane</i> and doing so without being seen, was
as simple as it was direct. The farther end
of her circular course would bring her over
Great South Bay and the South shore of
Long Island at approximately the same
point for which the other plane seemed to
be bound. She would arrive, of course, a
minute or two behind the other aviator.
And as she planned, so it happened.</p>

<p>From her high point of vantage,
Dorothy, swinging on her arc a mile or so
to the east, was able to keep the other amphibian
continually in sight. She watched
him pursue his southerly course until he
came over the town of Babylon on Great
South Bay. Here her glasses told her that
the bearded aviator turned his plane to
the left, heading east and up the bay in her
direction.</p>

<p>Below her now lay the Bay, hemmed in
from the Atlantic by long narrow stretches
of white sand dunes. For a second or so
Dorothy thought they would pass in the
air, her plane far above the other. But before
she reached that point, she saw the
other make a crosswind landing and taxi
toward a dock which jutted into the Bay
from the dunes. Just beyond the dock an
isolated cottage stood in a hollow on the
bay side of the dunes. There was no other
habitation in sight for over a mile in either
direction.</p>

<p>“Aha! Run to earth at last!” muttered
Dorothy contentedly. Maintaining her
altitude, with Babylon across the bay to
her right, she continued her westward
course above the dunes.</p>

<p>A few miles past the cottage she flew
over Fire Island Inlet. When she was opposite
Amityville, she came about. Shutting
off her engine, she tilted the stick forward
and sent <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> into a
long glide which eventually landed her on
the waters of Babylon harbor.</p>

<p>Dorothy stripped off her goggles and
scanned the waterfront. Slightly to her
left she spied a small shipyard, whose long
dock bore a large sign which carried the
legend: “Yancy’s Motor Boat Garage.”</p>

<p>“Good. Couldn’t be better!” exclaimed
Miss Dixon in great satisfaction. “Atta
girl, Wispy! We’re going over to have a
talk with Mr. Yancy.”</p>

<p>She gave her plane the gun and taxiing
slowly over the smooth water, through the
harbor shipping, presently brought up at
the Yancy wharf and made fast.</p>

<p>“Hello, there! Want gas?” sang out a
voice above her, and Dorothy looked up.
A smiling young man, dressed in extremely
dirty dungarees was walking down the
wharf toward her.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself!” she returned as he
came up. “No, I’m not out of gas, thank
you. I want to hire a boat.”</p>

<p>“Better come ashore, then.” The man
wiped his palms on a piece of clean cotton
waste and gave her a hand up. “We’ve got
plenty of boats—all kinds, lady. Got ’em
fast and slow, big and little. Just what
kind of a craft do you need?”</p>

<p>“Something with plenty of beam and seaworthy,
that I can run without help. I’m
not looking for speed. I may want to take
her outside—I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The young man pointed down the wharf
to where a rather bulky motor boat, broad
of beam and about thirty feet waterline was
moored head out to a staging.</p>

<p>“<i>Mary Jane</i>—that’s your boat,” announced
Mr. Yancy. “She’s old and she
ain’t got no looks, but she’s seaworthy and
she’ll take you anywhere. You could run
over to Paris or London in that old craft
if you could pile enough gas aboard her.”</p>

<p>“She looks pretty big,” Dorothy’s tone
was dubious. “Think I can handle her by
myself?”</p>

<p>“She is big,” he admitted readily, “but
she runs like a sewing machine and she’s
all set to be taken out this minute if you
want her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look her over anyway,” she declared
and led the way to the landing stage.</p>

<p>Stepping aboard the <i>Mary Jane</i>, she
peeped into the small trunk cabin which
was scarcely bigger than a locker, but
would give shelter in case of rain. She observed
that there were sailing lights, compass,
horn and a large dinner bell in a
rack, and two life preservers as well. In
one of the lockers she came upon a chart.
Stowed up in the forepeak were an anchor
with a coil of line and three five-gallon tins
of gasoline. A quick examination showed
the fuel tank to have been filled.</p>

<p>The motor was a simple and powerful
two-cylinder affair, with make-and-break
ignition, noisy, but dependable; the sort of
engine on which the fishermen and lobstermen
along the coast hang their lives in
offshore work. It seemed to Dorothy that
it ought to kick the shallow old tub along
at a good ten-knot gait. The boat itself
though battered and dingy, appeared to be
sound and staunch so far as one could see.</p>

<p>“I’ll take her,” decided Dorothy. “That
is, if she’s not too expensive?”</p>

<p>“I guess we ain’t goin’ to fight about the
price, mam,” asserted Yancy. “How long
will you be wantin’ her and when do you
expect to take her out?”</p>

<p>“Not before nine tonight—and I’ll hire
her for twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“O. K. mam. You can have her for a
year if you want her. How about your
air bus?”</p>

<p>“She’ll be left here. I want you to look
after her. I don’t think there’ll be any
wind to speak of. She’ll be all right where
she is.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to get rain in a couple
of hours, so if you’ll make her secure, I’ll
have her towed out to that buoy yonder.
I’ll rest easier with her moored clear of
this dock.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pull the waterproof covers over the
cockpits and she’ll be all right,” returned
Dorothy. “Then we can go up to your
office and fix up the finances.”</p>

<h2 id='ch06' class='c007'><i>Chapter VI</i><br /><br />THE HOUSE ON THE DUNES</h2>

<p class='c006'>Having come to agreeable terms with
Mr. Yancy and having secured the name
and location of Babylon’s best restaurant,
Dorothy left the waterfront and walked
uptown. A glance at her wrist-watch told
her it was not yet seven o’clock. She was
in no hurry, for she had more than two
hours to wait before it would be dark
enough to start. So she strolled along the
bustling streets of the little city, feeling
very much pleased with the way things
were progressing.</p>

<p>Arrived at the restaurant, she ordered a
substantial meal and while waiting for it
to be served, sought a telephone booth. She
asked for the toll operator and put in a call
for New Canaan. A little while later she
was summoned to the phone.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Lizzie? Yes. I—no, no,
I’m perfectly all right—” she spoke soothingly
into the transmitter. “Don’t worry
about me, please. I’ve had to go out of
town, and I wanted to let you know that I
won’t be back till morning. Never mind,
now. I’ll see you tomorrow. Good-by!”
She replaced the receiver and went back to
her table, a little smile on her lips at the
memory of Lizzie’s distracted voice over
the wire.</p>

<p>“Poor Lizzie! She’s all worked up
again at what she calls my ‘wild doin’s’,”
she thought. And with a determined glint
in her eyes, she proceeded to eat heartily.</p>

<p>When she had finished, she asked at the
desk for a sheet of paper and an envelope.
She took these over to her table, ordered a
second cup of coffee, and began to compose
a letter. This took her some time, for
in it she explained her maneuvers during
the afternoon, and gave the exact location
of the cottage on the dunes, where she
believed the <i>Mystery Plane’s</i> pilot had been
bound. She ended with a sketch of her
plans for the evening and addressed the envelope
to Terry Walters’ father. With her
mind now easy in case of misadventure, she
paid her bill and walked back to the water
front.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Miss Dixon,” greeted
Yancy as she stepped into his office. “I’ve
done what you asked me to. You’ll find
a pair of clean blankets, some fresh water
and eatables for two days stowed in the
<i>Mary Jane’s</i> cabin. I know you don’t intend
to be out that long, but it’s always wise
to be on the safe side with the grub.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. You’re a great help. Now,
just one thing more before I shove off. Although
I’ve rented your boat for twenty-four
hours, I really expect to be back here
tomorrow morning at the latest. If I don’t
turn up by noon, will you please send this
letter by special delivery to Mr. Walters
in New Canaan?”</p>

<p>“I sure will, Miss Dixon. But you’re
not lookin’ for trouble, are you?”</p>

<p>Dorothy shook her head and smiled.
“Nothing like that, Mr. Yancy. I just
want Mr. Walters to know where I am and
what I’m doing.”</p>

<p>“Good enough, Mam. Anything else I
can do?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, thank you. Don’t bother
to come down to the wharf with me. I’ve
got several things I want to do aboard before
I set out.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say. Good luck and a pleasant
trip.” Yancy’s honest face wore a
beaming grin as he doffed his tattered cap
to Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Thank you again. Good night.”</p>

<p>Dorothy went outside and found that
Yancy’s prediction of rain earlier in the
evening had been justified.</p>

<p>“Lucky this is drizzle instead of fog,”
she thought as she hurried down to the
landing stage. “I’d be out of luck navigating
blind on Great South Bay!”</p>

<p>She dove into the <i>Mary Jane’s</i> cabin and
after lighting the old fashioned oil lamp
in its swinging bracket, put on her slicker
and sou’wester. Then she fished the chart
of the bay out of the locker and spent the
next quarter of an hour in an intensive
study of local waters.</p>

<p>Having gained an intimate picture of
this part of the bay, she plotted her course,
and checked up on the blankets and food.
That done, she blew out the lamp, picked
up the anchor and left the cabin, closing
the door behind her.</p>

<p>Outside in the drizzle, she deposited her
burden in the bow, making the anchor rope
fast to a ring bolt in the decking. Then
she put a match to the side lights and coming
aft, cast off from the staging. Next,
she started the motor, a difficult undertaking.
At the third or fourth heave of the
heavy flywheel it got away with a series of
barking coughs. She slid in behind the
steering wheel and they headed out across
the bay.</p>

<p>Night had fallen, but notwithstanding
the light rain, visibility on the water was
good. The tide, as Dorothy knew, was at
the flood, so she cut straight across for the
dull, intermittent glow of the Fire Island
Light. The boat ran strongly and well and
Dorothy gave the engine full gas. She
knew from experience that one of its primitive
type was not apt to suffer from being
driven, but on the contrary was inclined
to run more evenly.</p>

<p>It had been at least two years since she
had sailed on Great South Bay, but she remembered
it to be a big, shallow puddle,
where in most places a person capsized
might stand on bottom and right the boat.</p>

<p>“No danger of capsizing with the <i>Mary
Jane</i>,” she reflected, “she’s built on the lines
of a flounder—I’ll bet she’d float in a heavy
dew!”</p>

<p>The two and a half feet of tide made it
possible for her to hold a straight course
and presently she could see the dim outline
of sand dunes. The faint easterly draft
of air brought the roar of the Atlantic swell
as it boomed upon the beach outside. It
was time to change her course.</p>

<p>A quarter turn of the wheel swung the
<i>Mary Jane</i> to port and straightening out,
she headed across the inlet. Five minutes
later she had picked up the dunes on the
farther side. With the dunes off her starboard
quarter, Dorothy made the wheel
fast with a bight of cord she had cut for the
purpose, and going forward, extinguished
her side lights.</p>

<p>Back at the wheel again, she steered just
as close to the shore as safety permitted.
For the next couple of miles she ran along
the shallows.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” she muttered at last.
Swinging the <i>Mary Jane</i> inshore, she cut
her motor and headed into a small cove, to
ground a moment later on a pebbly beach.</p>

<p>Springing ashore, Dorothy dragged the
anchor up the beach and buried it at its
full length of rope in the sand. Then with
a sigh of satisfaction, she straightened her
back and took a survey of her surroundings.</p>

<p>The little beach ran up to a cup-shaped
hollow, encompassed by high sand dunes.
She had noticed the inlet on the large-scale
chart, and chose it because she figured that
it lay about a mile on the near side of the
cottage she sought. And since she had decided
to use the motor boat instead of the
plane because she wanted to cover her approach,
this spot seemed made to order for
her purpose.</p>

<p>Her eyes scanned the skyline, and for a
moment her heart almost stopped. Surely
she had seen the head of a man move in
that clump of long, coarse grasses at the
top of the incline! Standing perfectly still,
although her body tingled with excitement,
she continued to stare at the suspicious
clump.</p>

<p>Then with characteristic decision, she
drew a revolver from her pocket and raced
up the side of the dune. But although she
exerted herself to the utmost, her progress
was much too slow. Her feet sank deep in
the shifting sand until she was literally
wading, clawing with her free hand for
holds on the waving sandgrass.</p>

<p>Panting and floundering, she pulled
herself to the top, only to find no one there.
Nor so far as she could see was there any
living thing in sight. The deep boom of
the surf was louder here, and peering
through the rain, she made out the long
stretch of beach pounded by combers, not
more than a couple of hundred yards away.
Some distance to the right, facing the
ocean twinkled the lights of a row of summer
cottages. To her left nothing could
be seen but tier after tier of grass-topped
dunes, a narrow barrier of sand between
Great South Bay and the Atlantic Ocean,
bleak and desolate, extending farther than
the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Despite this evidence to the contrary,
Dorothy still retained the impression that
she was not alone. She had an uneasy conviction
that she was being watched. She
shivered.</p>

<p>“My nerves must be going fuzzy,” she
thought disgustedly. “I can’t risk using a
flash, and if there were any tracks this stiff
breeze from the sea would have filled them
in while I was climbing up here. Well,
get going, Dorothy, my girl—this place is
giving you the creeps—good and plenty.”</p>

<p>The Colt was slipped back into her
slicker, and she trudged through the loose
sand to the black stretch of ocean beach.
Here, walking was better, and turning her
back on the lighted cottages, she set out
along the hard shingle by the surf.</p>

<p>Several times during that walk, Dorothy
stopped short and scanned the long line of
dunes above her. Try as she might, it
seemed impossible to rid herself of the
idea that someone was following. When
she judged the remaining distance to the
cottage to be about a quarter of a mile, she
left the beach and continued her way over
the dunes.</p>

<p>Although Dorothy had no tangible fact
to connect the <i>Mystery Plane</i> with her
holdup in New Canaan and Terry’s disappearance,
she approached the lonely cottage
with the stealth of a red Indian. And
even if this night reconnoiter should prove
only that the bearded aviator had a sweetie
living on the shore of Great South Bay, or
that he was making daily trips to visit
friends, she had no intention of being
caught snooping. No matter what she
should learn of the cottage’s inmates, if
anything, she proposed to return with the
<i>Mary Jane</i> to Yancy’s wharf and spend the
rest of the night aboard. She had no desire
to tramp about Babylon after midnight,
looking for a hotel that would take her in.</p>

<p>As she slowly neared the cottage, taking
particular pains now not to appear on the
skyline, she wished that this adventure was
well over. She still felt the effects of her
adventure with the thunderhead. The tiny
cabin of the motor boat seemed more and
more inviting to the weary girl. Trudging
through the rain over sand dunes was especially
trying when one was walking
away from bed rather than toward it.</p>

<p>Then she caught sight of the house roof
over the top of the next dune and her flagging
interest in her undertaking immediately
revived.</p>

<p>Dorothy skirted the shoulder of the
sandy hill, using the utmost precaution to
make not the slightest sound. Then she
squatted on her heels and held her breath.
Directly ahead, not more than thirty or
forty feet at most, gleamed the light from
an open window, and from where she
crouched, there was an unobstructed view
of the room beyond.</p>

<p>There were three men sitting about an
unpainted kitchen table which held three
glasses and as many bottles. All were
smoking, and deep in conversation. One
man she knew immediately to be the
bearded aviator with whom she had talked
on the Beach Club shore. But although
Dorothy strained her ears to the bursting
point, the heavy pounding of the surf from
the ocean side prevented her from catching
more than a confused rumble of voices.</p>

<p>For a moment or two she waited and
watched. The other two men wore golf
clothes, were young, and though they were
not particularly prepossessing in appearance,
she decided that they were American
business men on a holiday. They certainly
did not look like foreigners.</p>

<p>Miss Dixon, crouching beside the sand
dune, felt vaguely disappointed. She did
not know exactly what she had expected to
find in the cottage, but she had been counting
on something rather more exciting than
the tableau now framed in the open window.
But since she had come this far, it
would be senseless not to learn all that was
possible. Taking care to keep beyond the
path of the light, she crept forward on her
hands and knees until she was below the
window. Here it was impossible to see into
the room, but the voices now came to her
with startling distinctness.</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired a voice which
Dorothy immediately recognized as belonging
to the aviator, though oddly
enough, it was now without accent. “You
surely haven’t got cold feet, Donovan?”</p>

<p>“Cold feet nothing! The man don’t live
that can give me chills below the knee,”
that gentleman returned savagely. “But I
won’t be made a goat of either, nor sit in a
poker game with my eyes shut. Why
should I? I’ve got as much to lose as you
have.”</p>

<p>“Those are my sentiments exactly,”
drawled a third voice, not unpleasantly.
“Listen to that surf. There’s a rotten sea
running out by the light. Raining too,
and getting thicker out there by the minute.
By three o’clock you’ll be able to cut
the fog with a knife. What’s the sense in
trying it—we’re sure to miss her, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you chaps would prefer my
job,” sneered the aviator. “You make me
sick! But you’ll have to do what the old
man expects of you,—so why argue?”</p>

<p>“How come the old man always picks
days like this to run up his red flag?” Donovan
was talking again. “There’s just as
much chance of our picking up that stuff
tonight as—as—”</p>

<p>“As finding a golf ball on a Scotchman’s
lawn,” the third man finished for him. “I
know there’s no use grousing—but it’s a
dirty deal—and well, we’ve got to talk
about something in this God-forsaken
dump!”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you much,” the aviator
admitted, “but look at the profits, man.
Well, I must be shoving off, myself. We’ll
have another bottle of beer apiece and—”</p>

<p>But Dorothy did not hear the end of
that sentence. Her vigil was suddenly and
rudely interrupted. Someone behind her
thrust a rough arm under her chin, jerking
back her head and holding her in an unbreakable
grip. The sickly-sweet odor of
chloroform half suffocated her. For a
moment more she struggled, then darkness
closed in about her.</p>

<h2 id='ch07' class='c007'><i>Chapter VII</i><br /><br />SHANGHAIED</h2>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy came slowly back to consciousness.
She was vaguely aware of the
chug-chug of a small engine somewhere
near by. Her head swam and there was a
sickly sensation at the pit of her stomach.</p>

<p>She tried to move, and found it impossible.
She heard the splash of waves but
could see nothing except the boarded wall
of her prison a foot or so away from her
eyes.</p>

<p>After a while she became accustomed to
the gloom and her sight was clearer. She
decided that the rounded wall was the side
of a boat. Turning her head slightly she
saw that she lay on the flooring of an open
motor sailor, beneath a thwart. It had
stopped raining. Now the sound of the
engine and the gurgle of water against the
hull told her that the craft was moving.</p>

<p>She hadn’t the slightest idea where this
cabinless craft was bound, or how she
came to be aboard. Gradually there returned
to her a confused memory of the
cottage on the dunes, voices through the
window. Someone’s arm about her neck,
forcing her head back—she remembered,
now, and groaned. Her body was one
stiffness and ache.</p>

<p>Again she tried to heave herself into a
sitting position, only to find that her
ankles were bound with a turn or two of
cord, and her wrists whipped together behind
her back. She was trussed like a
fowl, and by the feel of her bonds, the
trusser was a seaman. She wriggled and
writhed, consumed by rage at her own
helplessness. The only result was to restore
her circulation and clear her faculties,
allowing her to realize just what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Shanghied!” Dorothy muttered
thickly. “Oh, if I’d only had a chance to
let loose a little jiu jitsu on that beast who
scragged me!”</p>

<p>Why had they brought her on board
this boat and tied her hand and foot?
Where was the motor sailor bound? What
was going to happen to her next? Mr.
Walters would probably get her letter during
the afternoon. Yancy seemed a dependable
sort of man. Without doubt a
raid on the beach cottage would follow,
but by that time the birds would have
flown, and what good would the raid do
her! Her thoughts ran on.</p>

<p>Those men in the cottage were not fools.
Their conversation, as they sat around the
table, had meant little to Dorothy, but she
no longer doubted that the gang was interested
in an undertaking that was illegal and
fraught with considerable danger to themselves.
Could it be bootlegging? Possibly.
But Dorothy did not fancy that
idea. The <i>Mystery Plane</i>, (she had got
in the habit of calling it that now) hadn’t
enough storage capacity to carry any great
quantity of liquor. Where did that amphibian
come into this complicated scheme?</p>

<p>This night’s work had turned out a failure
so far as she was concerned: she should
never have undertaken the job of ferreting
out the truth alone.</p>

<p>If only Bill Bolton were not away. He
would never have allowed her to get into
this mess!</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the creak of a board
and the sound of footsteps approaching.
Dorothy realized that she lay huddled in
the bow of the craft, with her head aft and
her feet forward. That was why she had
not been able to see anything of the crew.
She shut her eyes again as someone flashed
a torch in her face.</p>

<p>“She’s not much better,” said a voice
she recognized as belonging to the man
called Donovan. “Doesn’t look to me as
if she’d be out of it for a long time. I think
you must have given her an overdose of
the stuff, Peters.” He stirred her none too
gently with his foot.</p>

<p>“I hope I did!” answered a new voice.
“That little wildcat got my thumb between
her teeth while I was holdin’ the rag to her
face. She bit me somethin’ terrible, I tell
yer.”</p>

<p>“Never mind your thumb. We’ve
heard enough of that already. How long
did you hold the chloroform to her nose?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I gave her plenty. If her
light’s out, I should worry.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, you should. I’m not
handling stiffs on the price of this job.”
Donovan’s tone was biting.</p>

<p>A hand pressed Dorothy’s side.</p>

<p>“No stiffer than you are,” affirmed Peters
matter-of-factly. “I can feel her
breathe.”</p>

<p>“She looks pretty bad to me,” Donovan
insisted. “The old man will raise the roof
if you don’t get her over to Connecticut
O.K. You know what he said over the
phone!”</p>

<p>“Then why not ask Charlie? He used
to be a doctor before he did that stretch up
the river.” He raised his voice. “Hey,
there, Charlie! Leave go that wheel and
come here for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” replied Charlie, and
Dorothy knew that the third man on the
beach cottage group was speaking. “What
do you want me to do—run this sailor
aground in the shallows?”</p>

<p>“Well, Donovan thinks the girl’s goin’
to croak.”</p>

<p>“That’s your worry. You’re the lad
who administered the anesthetic. You
probably gave her too much.”</p>

<p>“Say, Charlie, this is serious,” Donovan
broke in anxiously. “Quit high-hatting
and give us your opinion.”</p>

<p>The steersman snorted contemptuously.
“She’ll come out of it all right—that is,
unless her heart’s wobbly. If it is, I
couldn’t do anything for her out here.
You’re supposed to be running this show,
Don, and Peters did your dirty work. I’m
only the hired man. If she goes out, you
two will stand the chance of burning, not
me. Cut the argument! There’s shipping
ahead. What are you trying to do—wake
the harbor?”</p>

<p>Donovan and Peters stopped talking
and went aft. Presently their voices broke
out again but this time came to the girl
in the bow as a low, confused murmur.</p>

<p>So she owed this situation to Mr. Peters.
Dorothy was feeling better now and despite
her discomfort she spent several minutes
contemplating what she would do to
Mr. Peters, if she ever got the chance.</p>

<p>The motor sailor’s engine stopped
chugging and soon the boat came to rest.</p>

<p>“I’ll carry her in myself,” spoke Donovan
from somewhere beyond her range
of vision. “Peters bungled the business
when he was on watch at that dump across
the bay. I want no more accidents until
she’s safely off my hands.”</p>

<p>Dorothy was caught up in a pair of
strong arms as if she had been so much
mutton.</p>

<p>“Think I’d drop her in the drink?”
laughed Peters.</p>

<p>“You said it.—Sure this is the right
dock, Charlie?”</p>

<p>“No, Donny, it’s the grill room of the
Ritz—shake a leg there, both of you.
We’ve got a long boat ride and a sweet
little job ahead of us. We can’t afford to
be late—hustle!”</p>

<p>Donovan did not bother to reply to this
parting shot. He slung Dorothy over his
shoulder, stepped onto a thwart, from
there to the gunwale and on to the dock.
They seemed to be in some kind of backwater
from where a set of steps led up from
the dock to a small wharfyard, shut in on
three sides by high walls and warehouses.</p>

<p>Donovan shouldered open a door and
ascended a narrow flight of rotting stairs.
It had been dark in the yard, but inside
the warehouse the night was Stygian. At
the top he waited until Peters came abreast.</p>

<p>“Where’s your flash, Peters?” he
growled.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got one, Cap.”</p>

<p>“Here—take mine, then, and show a
glim. It’s in my side pocket. My hands
are full of girl!”</p>

<p>“Got it,” said Peters, a moment later.</p>

<p>The light came on and Dorothy, between
half-shut eyelids saw that they were
in a long, dismal corridor.</p>

<p>“I’ll go ahead,” continued the man, “I’ve
got the key.”</p>

<p>Down this long corridor they passed,
then into another narrow passage running
at right angles from the first.</p>

<p>Peters eventually stopped at a door
which he unlocked and flung open.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he announced and preceded
them over the sill.</p>

<p>Dorothy caught a glimpse of a small
room that smelt of rats and wastepaper
with a flavor of bilgewater thrown in.
Then she closed her eyes as Donovan
dumped her on the bare floor, propping
her shoulders against the wall.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s done,” Donovan said with
great satisfaction. “Are you going to
wait here for the car, Peters, or out in the
yard?”</p>

<p>“The yard for mine, Cap. This joint
is full o’ spooks. It’s jollier outside.”</p>

<p>“Right. We’ll get going then.”</p>

<p>Peters paused and looked at the girl.
“There might be some change—maybe a
bill or two in the lady’s pockets, Cap?”
He winked at Donovan hopefully.</p>

<p>“You leave the girl’s money alone. The
boss distinctly said not to search her. He
wants her delivered just as she is.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if she passes out on me
hands, Cap?”</p>

<p>“Deliver her just the same. And mind—you
obey orders or you’ll bite off a heap
more trouble than you can chew. Come
along now!”</p>

<p>The two men left the room. The bolt
in the door shot home, then the key turned
in the lock; As the sound of their footsteps
over the bare floor died away, Dorothy
opened her eyes. Summoning all her
strength, she wrenched at the bonds that
held her, but she accomplished no more
than lacerating her wrists.</p>

<p>She was to be shifted to some safer place,
presumably in Connecticut, where she
was to be taken by car. Meanwhile, there
was no escape from where she was, even
if her limbs were free. Should she show
signs of consciousness, the best she had
to hope for was another dose of chloroform
or a gag when that enterprising thug, Mr.
Peters, returned. He was not the kind to
leave anything to chance.</p>

<p>Almost before she had got her wits to
work, Dorothy heard steps in the passage
and let herself go limp again, her knees
drawn up, her head and neck against the
wall. The bolt was drawn, and Peters entered
the room. He flashed the torch over
his prisoner.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’ll be any harm in
me takin’ a dollar or two,” he muttered.
“What’s the use of money to a stiff? And
you sure do look good and dead, young
woman!” he chuckled as he bent down
to begin the search.</p>

<p>“Guess again!”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s bound feet shot upward with
the force of a mainspring uncoiling. Her
neck was braced against the wall and the
whole strength of her thighs was behind
the kick that drove her boot heels smashing
under her captor’s chin. The gangster
sailed backward. His head hit the
base of the opposite wall with a resounding
crack and he lay like a log.</p>

<p>The electric torch trundled over the
planks and came to a standstill, throwing
its pencil of light across the floor. For a
couple of seconds, Dorothy peered and
listened. Then with intense exhilaration
of spirit, she rolled and wriggled herself
across the intervening space until she was
underneath the window. Here, after a
little straining and wobbling, that nearly
cracked her sinews, she got on her knees.
Then she heaved herself upright so that
she leaned sideways against the sash. With
a thrust she drove her elbow through the
pane. There was a crash and a tinkle of
falling glass.</p>

<p>Two more thrusts shivered the pane until
there remained only a fringe of broken
glass at either side. Turning her back to
it, she felt for the broken edge with her
fingers and brought her rope-lashed wrists
across it. Splintered window glass has an
edge like a razor. Dorothy fumbled the
cord blindly to the cutting edge, sawed
steadily and felt one of the turns slacken
and part.</p>

<p>It was enough. In a few seconds her
wrists were free and she stooped and cast
loose the lashings from her ankles. She
staggered a little and collapsed on the
floor. After chafing her arms and legs,
she turned to attend to her companion.</p>

<p>There was no need. Mr. Peters showed
no further sign of animation than a ham.
To insure against interference or pursuit,
Dorothy turned him over, untied a length
of cord from her ankle-bonds, and cast a
double sheet-bend about his wrists.</p>

<p>Picking up the flashlight, she hurried
out through the door which that canny
seeker of “pickings” had left open. She
hurried along the two passages and down
the rickety stairs. The door at the bottom
was closed, so snapping off her light, she
pulled it open and stepped into the
yard.</p>

<p>But here she was certain there was no
egress except by swimming unless she
could find a way through the other side
of the house. Somewhere out in the darkness
she heard the lap and plash of
water and the faint creak of rowlocks.
Instantly she ducked behind a pile of
empty barrels.</p>

<p>A boat skulled stealthily through the
gloom and fetched up alongside the dock.
A tall figure made the little craft fast,
climbed the steps and peered around the
yard.</p>

<p>At that very moment, a water rat
dropped from the top of the wall to the
ground by way of Dorothy’s shoulder. It
was impossible for her to suppress the exclamation
of fright that escaped her.</p>

<p>The figure in the middle of the yard
swung round and an electric torch flashed
over the barrels.</p>

<p>“Come out of that or I’ll shoot!” ordered
the stranger. “And come out with
your hands up!”</p>

<h2 id='ch08' class='c007'><i>Chapter VIII</i><br /><br />THE CORK CHAIN</h2>

<p class='c006'>With the white sabre of light blinding
her vision, Dorothy walked out from behind
the stack of barrels, hands above her
head.</p>

<p>“<em>Dorothy!</em>” exclaimed the tall figure
in astonishment. “What on earth are you
doing here?”</p>

<p>There was an instant’s pause; then Dorothy
giggled.</p>

<p>“Gee, what a relief—but you scared me
out of six years’ growth, Bill Bolton!”</p>

<p>As her arms dropped to her sides, she
staggered and would have fallen if Bill
had not stepped quickly forward and
placed his arm about her. He led her to
an empty packing case and forced her to
sit down. The surprise of this meeting
coming as a climax to the strenuous events
of the evening had just about downed her
splendid nerves.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bill—” she sobbed hysterically on
his shoulder—“you can’t guess how glad
I am to see you. I’ve really had an awful
time of it tonight.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy and have a good cry. Everything’s
all right now. You’ll feel better
in a minute,” he soothed.</p>

<p>“What a crybaby you must think me,”
she said presently, in a limp voice. “Do
you happen to have a handkerchief, Bill?”</p>

<p>“You bet. Here’s one—and it’s clean,
too.”</p>

<p>Dorothy dried her eyes and blew her
nose rather violently.</p>

<p>“Thanks—I do feel much better now.
Do you mind turning on the light again?
I must be a sight. There—hold it so I can
see in my compact.”</p>

<p>Bill began to laugh as her deft fingers
worked with powder, rouge and lipstick.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?” she asked, then answered
her own question. “Oh, I know!
You think girls do nothing but prink.
Well, I don’t care—it’s horrid to look
messy. Is there such a thing as a comb
in your pocket, Bill? I have lost mine.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” he grinned, “but I got my permanent
last week. I don’t bother to carry
one any more.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly!” she began, then stopped
short. “We’ve got to get out of here,” she
said and snapped her compact shut. “They
are coming after me in a car. Donovan
or Peters, I forget which, said so.”</p>

<p>“Who are Donovan and Peters—and
where are they going to take you?”</p>

<p>“Not that pair—other members of the
same gang. D. and P. are two of the crew
over at the beach cottage who chloroformed
me, then tied me up and carted me
over here in an open motor sailor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be tarred and feathered!”
Bill switched off his torch. “Here I’ve
been following you for over two hours
and never knew it <em>was</em> you! Never got a
glimpse of your face, of course—took you
for a man in that rig! Well, I’ll be jiggered
if that isn’t a break!”</p>

<p>“So <em>you</em> were the man I thought I saw
in the grass clump?”</p>

<p>“Sure. You led me to the house. I
knew the gang had a cottage somewhere
along that beach, but I didn’t know which
one it was. By the way, I’ve got your
<i>Mary Jane</i> tied to a mooring out yonder—Couldn’t
take a chance on running in
closer. That old tub’s engine has a bark
that would wake George Washington.”</p>

<p>Dorothy sprang to her feet. “That’s
great! We’ll make for the <i>Mary Jane</i>,
Bill, right now. If those men in the car
catch us here there’ll be another fight.
Dorothy has had all the rough stuff she
wants for one night, thank you!”</p>

<p>Bill took her arm.</p>

<p>“O.K. with me,” he returned. “Think
you’re well enough to travel?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right. Hanging around this
place gives me the jim-jams—let’s go.”</p>

<p>Together they crossed the yard and
hurried along the narrow planking of the
dock to the dinghy. Bill took the oars and
a few minutes later they were safely aboard
the motor boat. It began to rain again and
the dark, oily water took on a vibrant,
pebbly look.</p>

<p>“Come into the cabin,” suggested Dorothy,
watching Bill make the painter fast.
“We’ll be drier there—and I’ve got about
a million questions for you to answer.”</p>

<p>“Go below, then. I’ll join you in a
minute.”</p>

<p>Dorothy slid the cabin door open and
dropped down on a locker. Presently
Bill followed and took a seat opposite her.</p>

<p>“Better not light the lamp,” he advised,
“it’s too risky now. By the way, Dorothy,
I’m darn glad to see you again.”</p>

<p>Dorothy smiled. “So ’m I. I’ve missed
you while you were away, and I sure do
need your help now. Tell me—where in
the wide world am I?”</p>

<p>“This tub is tied up to somebody else’s
mooring off the Babylon waterfront,—if
that’s any help to you.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is. I hate to lose my bearings.
Here’s another: I don’t suppose you
happen to know what this is all about?”</p>

<p>Bill crossed his knees and leaned back
comfortably.</p>

<p>“There’s not much doubt in my mind,
after tonight’s doings. Those men in the
beach cottage are diamond smugglers and
no pikers at the game, take it from me!”</p>

<p>“Ooh!” Dorothy’s eyes widened. “Diamonds,
eh! That’s beyond my wildest
dreams. How do they smuggle them,
Bill?”</p>

<p>“Well, these fellows have a new wrinkle
to an old smuggling trick. Somebody
aboard an ocean liner drops a string of
little boxes, fastened together at long intervals—the
accomplices follow the
steamer in a boat and pick them up. And
now, from what I’ve found out, there’s
every reason to believe that this gang are
chucking their boxes overboard in the
neighborhood of Fire Island Light.”</p>

<p>Dorothy sat bold upright, her eyes snapping
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Listen, Bill! Those men in the cottage—I
heard them talking, you know—couldn’t
make anything out of their conversation
then, but now I’m beginning to
understand part of it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell me they were arguing
against going somewhere—or meeting
someone—in the fog?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. It was the man they
called Charlie—the one who’d been a
physician. Let me see ... he said that
there was a rotten sea running out by the
light. That must mean the Fire Island
Light! Then, listen to this. He was sure
that by three o’clock the fog off the light
would be thick enough to cut with a
knife—and that they would probably miss
her anyway!—Don’t you see? ‘Her’
means the liner they are to meet off the
Fire Island Light about three o’clock this
morning!”</p>

<p>“Good work, Miss Dixon—” Bill
nodded approvingly. “And that is where
Donovan and Charlie headed for when
they parked you with Peters,” he supplemented.
“On a bet, they’re running their
motor sailor out to the light right now.”</p>

<p>Dorothy glanced at the luminous dial
of her wrist watch.</p>

<p>“It is just midnight. Think we have time
to make it?”</p>

<p>“Gosh, that’s an idea! But, look here,
Dorothy—” Bill hesitated, then went on
in a serious tone, “if we run out to the lightship
and those two in the motor sailor spot
us, there’s likely to be a fight.”</p>

<p>Dorothy moved impatiently. “What of
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know—but you’ll stand a mighty
good chance of getting shot. This thing is
a deadly business. They’re sure to be
armed. Now, listen to me. I’ll row you
ashore and meet you in Babylon after I’ve
checked up on those guys.”</p>

<p>Dorothy stood up and squeezing past
Bill, opened the cabin door.</p>

<p>“And my reply to you is—<em>rats</em>!” she
flung back at him. “Of course I’m going
with you. There’ll be no argument, please.
Get busy and turn over that flywheel while
I go forward and slip our mooring.”</p>

<p>Bill made no answer, but with a resigned
shrug, followed her out to the cockpit.
They had known each other only a few
months, but their acquaintance had been
quite long enough to demonstrate that
when Miss Dixon spoke in that tone of
voice, she meant exactly what she said.
Bill knew that nothing short of physical
force would turn the girl from her project,
so making the best of things as he found
them, he started the engine.</p>

<p>Bill was heading the boat across the bay
when Dorothy came aft again. She went
inside the cabin and presently emerged
with a thermos of hot coffee, some sandwiches
and hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>“We may both get shot or drowned,”
she remarked philosophically, “but we
needn’t starve in the meantime.”</p>

<p>“Happy thought!” Bill bit into a sandwich
with relish, “One drowns much
more comfortably after having dined.”</p>

<p>“Hm! It would be a cold wet business,
though. Doubly wet tonight.” She looked
at the black water pock-marked with raindrops
and shook her head. “Hand me another
sandwich, please. Then tell me how
<em>you</em> came to be mixed up with this diamond
smuggling gang, Bill.”</p>

<p>By this time they were well on their way
across Great South Bay toward the inlet.
From the bows came the steady gurgle and
chug of short choppy seas as the stiff old
tub bucked them. Holding a straight
course, the two by the wheel were able to
make out the grey-white gleam of sand on
Sexton Island.</p>

<p>“Well, it was like this,” began Bill.
“You remember the Winged Cartwheels.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Well that was a Secret Service job for the
government.”</p>

<p>“I know,” nodded Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying—because of that
and some other business, Uncle Sam knew
that I could pilot a plane. Six weeks ago
I was called to Washington and told that
an international gang of criminals were
flooding this country with diamonds,
stolen in Europe. What the officials didn’t
know was the method being used to
smuggle them into this country. However,
they said they had every reason to believe
that the diamonds were dropped
overboard from trans-Atlantic liners somewhere
off the coast and picked up by the
smugglers’ planes at sea. My job was to
go abroad and on the return trip, to keep
my eyes peeled night and day for airplanes
when we neared America.”</p>

<p>“Did you go alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I gathered that practically
every liner coming over from Europe was
being covered by a Secret Service operative.
I made a trip over and back without spotting
a thing. On the second trip back,
something happened.”</p>

<p>“When was that?”</p>

<p>“Night before last. The liner I was
aboard had just passed Fire Island lightship.
I stood leaning over the rail on the
port side and I saw half a dozen or more
small boxes dropped out of a porthole.
They seemed to be fastened together. Once
in the water, they must have stretched out
over a considerable distance. Of course,
there are notices posted forbidding anyone
to throw anything overboard: and there are
watchmen on deck. But they can’t very
well prevent a person from unscrewing a
porthole and shoving something out!”</p>

<p>“Did you report it?”</p>

<p>“You bet. The skipper knew why I
was making the trip. We located the stateroom
and found that it belonged to three
perfectly harmless Y.M.C.A. workers who
were peaceably eating their dinner at the
time. Somebody slipped into their room
and did the trick.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear or see any plane?”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a motor, but it didn’t
sound like the engine of a plane. I couldn’t
be sure.”</p>

<p>“The motor sailor, probably?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it, now. Well, to continue:
I landed in New York and took the next
train to Babylon. Then I got me a room
in one of those summer cottages on the
beach. I was out on the dunes for a prowl
when the <i>Mary Jane</i> put in at that little
cove. That in itself seemed suspicious, so
I followed you to the house and saw Peters
scrag you. Although, at the time I had no
idea who you were. Then when they tied
you up and went off with you in the motor sailor,
I knew for certain that some dirty
work was on. So I beat it back to the cove
and came along in this old tub.”</p>

<p>Dorothy finished the last of the coffee.</p>

<p>“Did you see the amphibian tied up to
the cottage dock?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. It took off just before the motor sailor left.”</p>

<p>“Just how do you figure that it comes
into the picture?”</p>

<p>“I think these people have a lookout stationed
farther up the coast—on Nantucket
Island, perhaps. When a ship carrying
diamonds is sighted off the Island, the lookout
wires to the aviator or his boss and the
plane flies over to let the men in the cottage
know when to expect her off the lightship.
Then when they pick up the loot,
he flies back with it to their headquarters
next day. Of course, I don’t know how far
wrong I am—”</p>

<p>“But he’s been doing it every day for
weeks, Bill—maybe longer. Surely they
can’t be smuggling diamonds every day in
the week?”</p>

<p>“He probably carries over their provisions
and keeps an eye on them generally.
I don’t know. What he is doing is only a
guess, on my part, anyway.”</p>

<p>Dorothy smothered a yawn. “Do you
suppose the red flag those men spoke of is
a signal of some kind?”</p>

<p>“Guess so. But look here, you’re dead
tired. I can run this tub by myself. Hop
in the cabin and take a nap. I’ll call you
when we near the lightship.”</p>

<p>“You must be sleepy, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I had an idea I might be up
most of the night, so slept until late this
afternoon. And after those sandwiches
and the coffee, I feel like a million dollars.
Beat it now and get a rest.”</p>

<p>Dorothy yawned again and stretched the
glistening wet arms of her slicker above
her head.</p>

<p>“Promise to wake me in plenty of time?”</p>

<p>“Cross my heart——”</p>

<p>“Good night, then.”</p>

<p>“Good night. Better turn in on the floor.
We’re going to run into a sea pretty soon.
Those lockers are narrow. Once we strike
the Atlantic swell you’ll never be able to
stay on one and sleep!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, partner, I’ll take your advice.”
She turned and disappeared below.</p>

<h2 id='ch09' class='c007'><i>Chapter IX</i><br /><br />DEEP WATER</h2>

<p class='c006'>The ebb tide soon caught the <i>Mary Jane</i>
in the suck of its swift current and the boat
rushed seaward. Presently she struck the
breakers and floundering through them
like a wounded duck, commenced to rise
and fall on the rhythmic ground swell.</p>

<p>Dorothy came out of the cabin rubbing
the sleep from her eyes.</p>

<p>“You didn’t take much of a rest,” said
Bill from his place at the wheel.</p>

<p>She yawned and caught at the cabin roof
to steady herself.</p>

<p>“<i>Mary Jane’s</i> gallop through the breakers
woke me up. Sleeping on a hard floor
isn’t all it’s cracked up to be—and the
cabin was awfully stuffy.”</p>

<p>“Are you as good a sailor as you are a
sport?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about this deep
water stuff, but I’ve never been seasick.
Thought I might be if I stayed in there any
longer, though.”</p>

<p>“Feel badly now?”</p>

<p>“No, this fresh air is what I needed. Is
that the lightship dead ahead? I just
caught the glow.”</p>

<p>“Yep. That’s Fire Island Light. I wish
this confounded drizzle would stop. The
swell is getting bigger and shorter. Must
be a breeze of wind not far to the east of
us.”</p>

<p>“D’you think we’re in time, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. The weather is probably
thick farther out and up the coast, and
the ship will be running at reduced speed.
It’s likely she’ll be an hour or so late. There
is a ship out yonder, but it’s a tanker or a
freighter.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Why, a liner would be showing deck
and cabin lights. Here comes the breeze—out
of the northeast.”</p>

<p>“It’s raining harder, too. Ugh! What
a filthy night.”</p>

<p>Bill nodded grimly in the darkness. “You
said a mouthful. It’ll be good and sloppy
out here in another hour or two. Jolly
boating weather, I don’t think! And we
can’t get back into the bay until daylight,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>The big boat continued to pound steadily
seaward and before long the lightship was
close abeam. Bill ran some distance outside
it, then stopped the engine.</p>

<p>“No use wasting gas,” he said, and emptied
one of the five-gallon tins into the fuel
tank.</p>

<p>He went into the cabin again and reappeared
with two life preservers.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky the law requires all sail and
motor craft to carry these things. Better
slip into one—I’ll put on the other.”</p>

<p>Dorothy lifted her eyebrows questioningly.
“Think we’re liable to get
wrecked?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that—but a life preserver
is great stuff when it comes to stopping bullets.”</p>

<p>“Gee, Bill, do you really expect a scrap?
There isn’t a sign of the motor sailor yet.”</p>

<p>“I know—but they’re out here somewhere,
just the same. Neither of us is
showing lights, so in this weather we’re not
likely to spot each other unless our boats
get pretty close. And if they do, those
hyenas won’t hesitate to shoot! Here, let
me give you a hand.”</p>

<p>Having put on the life preservers over
their dripping slickers, they sat down and
waited. The wind was freshening. A
strong, steady draft blew out of the northeast
and it was gradually growing colder.
The rain had turned into sleet, fine and
driving, but not thick enough to entirely
obscure the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Bill—<em>sleet!</em> That’s the
limit, really—do you suppose we’ll ever
sight the ship through this?” Dorothy’s
tone was thoroughly disgusted.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he replied cheerfully, “this
isn’t so bad. Her masthead lights should
have a visibility of two or three miles, at
least.”</p>

<p>Dorothy said nothing, but, hands thrust
deep into her pockets and with shoulders
hunched, she stared moodily out to sea.</p>

<p>For about an hour they drifted, the
broad-beamed motor boat wallowing in
the chop which crossed the ground swell.
Twice Bill started the motor and worked
back to their original position. He did not
like the look of things, but said nothing to
Dorothy about it. The wind grew stronger
and seemed to promise a gale. The low
tide with the line of breakers across the
mouth of the inlet would effectually bar
their entrance to Great South Bay for the
next ten hours. And he doubted if they
would have enough fuel for the run of
nearly fifty miles to the shelter of Gravesend
Bay.</p>

<p>Then as they floundered about, he heard
the distant, muffled bellow of a big ship’s
foghorn. Again it sounded; and twice
more, each time coming closer. Bill
started the engine and headed cautiously
out in the direction from whence it came.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded a blast startlingly
close to the <i>Mary Jane</i>. This was
answered from the lightship, and through
the flying scud and sleet they saw a vivid
glare. Bill put his helm hard over and
when the steamer had passed about four
hundred yards away, he turned the motor
boat again to cut across the liner’s wake.
Faint streams of music reached their ears
emphasizing the dreariness of their position.</p>

<p>Directly they were astern of the great
ship, he swung the <i>Mary Jane</i> into the
steamer’s course. Running straight before
the wind, it was easy to follow the
sudsy brine that eddied in her wake. He
was by no means certain, however, that he
could keep the dull glow of her taffrail
light in sight. That depended upon the
liner’s speed, which might be more than the
<i>Mary Jane</i> could develop. But he soon discovered
he had either underestimated the
power of the motor boat or, what was more
probable, the steamer had reduced her own.
Before long he was obliged to slow down
to keep from overhauling.</p>

<p>And so for nearly an hour they tagged
along, astern, keeping a sharp lookout on
the band of swirling water. Little by little
their spirits sank, as no floating object appeared
to reward their perseverance. The
weather was becoming worse and worse,
but the sea was not troublesome; partly because
the <i>Mary Jane</i> was running before
it and partly because the great bulk of the
liner ahead flattened it out in her displacement.</p>

<p>“If this keeps on much longer, we’re going
to run short of gas,” said Dorothy, still
peering ahead. “Any idea how long it
<em>will</em> keep up?”</p>

<p>Bill shrugged and swung the boat’s head
over a point.</p>

<p>“Not the dimmest. I’m beginning to
wonder if we’ll have to follow her all the
way to the pilot station and then cut across
for Gravesend Bay.”</p>

<p>“We’ll sure be out of luck if we run out
of fuel with this wind backing into the
northwest. It will blow us clean out to
sea!”</p>

<p>“Take the wheel!” said Bill abruptly.
“I’m going to see where we stand.”</p>

<p>Dorothy, with her hands on the spokes,
saw him measure the gasoline in the tank
and then shake his head.</p>

<p>“How about it?” she called.</p>

<p>“Not so good,” he growled, and poured
in the contents of another tin. “This engine
is powerful, but when you say it’s
primitive, you only tell the half of it. The
darn thing laps up gas like a—”</p>

<p>“<em>Bill!</em>” Dorothy raised her arm—“there’s
another motor boat ahead!”</p>

<p>Both of them stared forward into the
gloom. For a moment Bill could see nothing
but the seething waters and the faint
glimmer of the liner’s taffrail light. Then
in an eddy of the driving sleet he caught
a glimpse of a dark bulk rising on a swell
a couple of hundred yards ahead. At the
same time they both heard the whir of a
rapidly revolving motor distinctly audible
between the staccato barks of their own exhaust.</p>

<p>“The motor sailor, Bill!”</p>

<p>“Sure to be. It must have cut in close
under the steamer’s stern. Let me take the
wheel again, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“O. K. Do you think they’ve seen us?”</p>

<p>“Not likely. They’ll be watching the
ship and her wake. To see us, they’d have
to stare straight into the teeth of the wind
and this blinding sleet.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll hear us, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Not a chance. That motor sailor’s got
one of those fast-turning jump-spark engines.
They run with a steady rattle.
There’s no interval between coughs. Ours
are more widely punctuated. Anyhow,
that’s the way I dope it. They’ve probably
signaled the ship by this time, and the contraband
ought to be dropped from a cabin
port at any time now.”</p>

<p>“Got a plan?”</p>

<p>“I think I have.”</p>

<p>He gave the boat full gas, then a couple
of spokes of the wheel sheered her off to
starboard.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” Dorothy thought he
had decided to give up the attempt. “Not
quitting, are we?”</p>

<p>“What do you take me for? Get out
that gun of yours and use your wits. I’m
goin’ to loop that craft and bear down on
them from abeam. If they beat it, O. K.
If they don’t, we’ll take a chance on crashing
them!”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em, boy!” Dorothy had
caught his excitement. “If they shoot, I’ll
fire at the flashes!”</p>

<p>Bill was working out his plan in detail
and did not reply. He felt sure his scheme
was sound. The <i>Mary Jane</i> was heavily
built, broad of beam, with bluff bows and
low freeboard. The motor sailor was a
staunch craft, too, but she was not decked
and with a load of but two men aboard she
would have no great stability. He was certain
that if he could work out and make his
turn so as to bear down upon her from a
little forward of the beam, striking her
amidships with the swell of his starboard
bow, she would crack like an egg.</p>

<p>Bill did not dare risk a head-on ram.
That might capsize them both. To cut into
her broadside at the speed she was making
would possibly tear off or open up his
own bows. The <i>Mary Jane</i> must strike her
a heavy but a glancing blow at an angle
of about forty-five degrees. Such a collision
meant taking a big chance with their
own boat. But the <i>Mary Jane</i> was half-decked
forward and the flare of her run
would take the shock on the level of her
sheer strake.</p>

<p>Quickly he explained his project.</p>

<p>“I’m taking a chance, of course, if I
don’t hit her right,” he finished.</p>

<p>“Go ahead—” she flung back. “I’m all
for it!”</p>

<p>Bill grinned at her enthusiasm, and with
the engine running full, he started to edge
off and work ahead. But he could not help
being impatient at the thought that the
contraband might be dropped at any minute
and hooked up by the others. He took
too close a turn. As the <i>Mary Jane</i> hauled
abreast about two hundred yards ahead,
the smugglers sighted them. Their motor sailor
swerved sharply to port, and with a
sudden acceleration, it dived into the gloom
and was lost to sight.</p>

<p>“Bluffed off!” he shouted triumphantly.</p>

<p>He turned the wheel and was swinging
back into the liner’s wake when Dorothy
gave a cry and pointed to the water off their
port quarter.</p>

<p>“Look! There! <em>There!</em>” she screamed.</p>

<p>Staring in the same direction, Bill saw
what at first he took to be a number of small
puffs of spume. Then he saw that they
were rectangular. The <i>Mary Jane</i> had
already passed them and a second later they
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>Bill nearly twisted off the wheel in an
effort to put about immediately. The result
was to slow down and nearly stop their
heavy boat. Gradually the <i>Mary Jane</i> answered
her helm and presently they were
headed back in the ship’s path.</p>

<p>And then as the <i>Mary Jane</i> was again
gathering speed, the motor sailor came
slipping out of the smother headed straight
for the contraband, her broadside presented
toward her pursuers.</p>

<p>“Stand by for a ram!” yelled Bill and
pulled out his automatic.</p>

<p>Not fifty yards separated the two boats.
Bows to the gale, the <i>Mary Jane</i> bore down
on the motor sailor. If those aboard her
realized their danger, they had no time to
dodge, to shoot ahead, or avoid the ram by
going hard astern. They swerved and the
<i>Mary Jane</i> struck full amidships with a
fearful grinding crash.</p>

<p>Bill caught a glimpse of two figures and
saw the flame streak out from their barking
guns. He felt a violent tug at his life
preserver. Then a yell rang out and the
two boats ground together in the heave of
the angry sea.</p>

<p>Steadying himself with a hand on the
wheel, he reversed and his boat hauled
away. As she backed off he heard the
choking cough of the other craft which had
now been blotted out by the darkness and
driving sleet.</p>

<p>Bill turned about with a triumphant cry
on his lips, then checked it suddenly as he
saw that Dorothy had fallen across the
coaming and was lying halfway out of the
boat.</p>

<h2 id='ch10' class='c007'><i>Chapter X</i><br /><br />WRECKED</h2>

<p class='c006'>The engine gave a grunt and stopped.
But Bill scarcely noticed it. Hauling desperately
to get Dorothy inboard, he
thought his heart would burst. Suddenly
he heard her cry:</p>

<p>“Don’t pull! Just hold me by my legs.”</p>

<p>She squirmed farther across the coaming
and he gripped her by the knees.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” she panted. “There—I’ve
got it! Now haul me in.”</p>

<p>Bill gave a heave and just then the boat,
caught by a huge wave, rolled far over and
landed Bill on his back with Dorothy
sprawled across him. As they struggled
to their feet he saw that she was laughing.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hurt at all?” he asked, rubbing
a bruised elbow.</p>

<p>“Only—out of—breath,” she gasped.
“They—are all—fastened together. Haul
them in.”</p>

<p>Glancing down, he saw that she was
holding one of the white boxes toward him.
He made no motion to take it, but stared to
windward, listening.</p>

<p>Dorothy could hear nothing but the
wind and the waves and the swirling sleet.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she jerked out, striving
to regain her breath.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.” Suddenly Bill
snatched up his electric torch and dove
into the cabin.</p>

<p>Dorothy dropped down on a thwart with
the box in her hand. After a short rest, she
renewed her endeavors to get the remainder
of her haul overside. When Bill
clambered out of the cabin she was tugging
at the strong line to which the boxes
were tied.</p>

<p>“It’s jammed, or caught, or something,”
she announced.</p>

<p>Bill looked overside.</p>

<p>“Yes, dash it all!” he growled. “We
fouled the line and wound it round the tail
shaft when I backed off just now. That’s
what stopped the motor, of course. Let me
see what I can do. You’re blown.”</p>

<p>He picked up another box bobbing
alongside and started to haul in the line.
One end of this he found was jammed under
the stern, while on the other length a
box appeared every thirty or forty feet.</p>

<p>“Ten, in all,” he told her and drew the
last aboard.</p>

<p>“Hooray! We’ve done it!” cried
Dorothy exultantly.</p>

<p>“We sure have. You just said it all—”
His tone was sarcastic. “The boat is leaking
like a sieve. That lateral wrench
started it. The propeller’s jammed. It’s
beginning to blow a gale and there isn’t
enough gas to run us out of it. Three cheers
and a tiger! Also, hooray!”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s enthusiasm evaporated. “Gee,
I’m sorry. I’m always such a blooming
optimist—I didn’t think about our real
difficulties.”</p>

<p>“O. K. kid. I apologize for being cross.
That water in the cabin kind of got me
for the moment. Let’s see what it looks like
here.”</p>

<p>He wrenched up the flooring and flashed
his torch.</p>

<p>Dorothy gave a gasp of dismay. The
boat was filling rapidly.</p>

<p>“I’ll get that bucket from the cabin,” she
said at once.</p>

<p>“Good girl! I’ve just got to get this
coffee mill grinding again, or we’ll be out
of luck good and plenty.”</p>

<p>Dorothy fetched the bucket and began
to bail. She saw that Bill was trying to
start the engine.</p>

<p>“The shaft wound up that line while we
were going astern,” he explained. “It
ought to unreel if I can send the old tub
ahead.”</p>

<p>Switching on the current, he managed
to get a revolution or two. Then the motor
stopped firing.</p>

<p>“No go?” inquired Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Not a chance!”</p>

<p>He ripped off his life preserver and slipping
out of his rubber coat, pulled forth a
jack-knife and opened it.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Dorothy
paused in her bailing.</p>

<p>“Get overboard and try to cut us loose.
Don’t stop! Keep at it for all you’re
worth. It’s our only chance of safety!”</p>

<p>Wielding her bucket in feverish haste,
she watched Bill lower himself over the
stern. The water pounded by this unseasonable
sleet must be freezingly cold.
She wished it were possible to help him.
Fortunately, the <i>Mary Jane</i> was light of
draft. He would not have to get his head
under, but that tough line must be twisted
and plaited and hard as wire. What if
his knife broke, or slipped from his
numbed fingers? Dorothy shuddered.
Meanwhile, the storm was getting worse
and the heavy boat drifted before it.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, Dorothy! Give me a hand
up!”</p>

<p>She dropped the bucket and sprang to
his assistance. Then, as his head came in
sight, she leaned over and gripping him
under the arms, swung him over the stern.</p>

<p>“My word—your strength’s inhuman—”
he panted.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense. Get busy and
start the engine. The water’s gaining fast.”</p>

<p>“Confound!” he exclaimed. “I’d no
idea the cockpit flooring was awash. Another
six inches and it will reach the carburetor.”</p>

<p>While Bill talked he was priming the
cylinder. A heave of the crank and the
motor started with a roar. Then he flashed
his light on the compass and after noting
the bearing of the wind, laid the <i>Mary Jane</i>
abeam it.</p>

<p>“Take the wheel,” he said to Dorothy.
“And steer just as we’re heading now.”</p>

<p>“What about the bailing, Bill?”</p>

<p>“My job. You’ve had enough of it.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not tired—”</p>

<p>“Don’t argue with the skipper!”</p>

<p>“But you’re soaked to the skin!”</p>

<p>“Of course I am—what I need is exercise—I’m
freezing!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry—here—turn over the
wheel, skipper.”</p>

<p>Dorothy grabbed the spokes and Bill
hastily slipped into his rubber coat and adjusted
the life belt over it.</p>

<p>“How are we headed?” she inquired.
“I can’t see the compass without a light.”</p>

<p>“Straight for shore, and we’ll be lucky
if the old tub stays afloat that long. The
whole Atlantic Ocean’s pouring in
through her seams.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the pump would be better?”</p>

<p>“No-sir: not that pump. I’ve seen it!”</p>

<p>“Mmm. That’s why I chose the bucket.
Say, I hope you won’t get a chill.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hope with you,” returned Bill and
kept his remaining breath for his labors.</p>

<p>A heavy wave broke against the <i>Mary
Jane’s</i> bow and swept them both with a deluge
of water. Dorothy paid off the boat’s
head half a point.</p>

<p>“Lucky that didn’t stall the motor for
good and all,” she observed grimly. “One
more like it, and we’ll be swimming.”</p>

<p>“Tide’s on the ebb,” grunted Bill.
“Wind’s barking around—it’ll be blowing
off the land in half an hour, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the old tub will last that
long? She’s getting terribly sluggish.
Steers like a truck in a swamp!”</p>

<p>“Listen!” he cried. “There’s your answer.”</p>

<p>From somewhere ahead came the unmistakable
booming roar of breakers. As
they topped the next wave Dorothy saw a
white band on the sea. She steadied the
wheel with her knee and tightened her life
preserver. She knew they could not hope
to reach the beach in the <i>Mary Jane</i>. Low
and open as she was, the first line of breakers
would fill her. The motor was still
pounding away when she leaned forward
and raised her voice to a shout.</p>

<p>“Stop bailing, Bill! Stand by to swim
for it!”</p>

<p>“O. K., kid.”</p>

<p>Bill dropped the bucket and dove for the
cabin. A second later he was back in the
cockpit with a three fathom length which
he had cut from the anchor line. He fastened
one end about Dorothy’s waist and
took a turn about his own body with the
other. Then, catching up a bight of the line
which secured the boxes he made it fast to
his belt with a slip hitch.</p>

<p>The <i>Mary Jane</i> was forging strongly
ahead, her actual weight of water being
about that of her customary load of passengers.
The swells began to mount, to
topple. Searching the shore, Dorothy
could see no sign of any light or habitation.</p>

<p>“If I’d known we were so nearly in, we
might have raised the coast guard with the
flash light.” Bill groaned his self-contempt.
“I ought to have kept an eye
out—and the Navy said I was a seaman!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly! It was my fault, if anyone’s.
You were busy bailing. Chances
are the light couldn’t have been seen from
shore, anyway. Gosh, what weather! Who
ever heard of sleet in August!”</p>

<p>“Look out—behind you!” yelled Bill.</p>

<p>A moment later she felt herself snatched
from the wheel and was crouching below
the bulwark with Bill’s arm around her
waist. Then as a brimming swell lifted
them sluggishly, its combing crest washed
into the boat. The next wave flung them
forward and crumpled over the gunwale.</p>

<p>The <i>Mary Jane’s</i> motor gave a strangled
cough and stopped. The boat yawed
off and came broadside on her stern upon
a line with the beach.</p>

<p>“This is what I hoped for,” he shouted in
her ear. “Gives us a chance to get clear.”</p>

<p>She saw him gather up the boxes and
fling them overboard.</p>

<p>“Keep close to me. We’ll need each
other in the undertow!” she yelled back at
him, as he pulled her to her feet.</p>

<p>Then as the next big comber mounted
and curled, they dove into the driving
water and the wave crashed down upon the
sinking boat. Dorothy felt her body being
whirled over and over, sucked back a little
and driven ahead again. The water was
paralyzingly cold, but she struck out
strongly and with bursting lungs reached
the surface. A second later, Bill’s head
bobbed up a couple of yards away. Blowing
the water from her nose, she saw they
were being washed shoreward. Her life
preserver, new and buoyant, floated her
well—almost too well. She found it difficult
to dive beneath the curling wavecrests
to prevent another rolling.</p>

<p>Bill was swimming beside her now and
as a great wave caught them up and carried
them forward he grasped her under
the arm.</p>

<p>There came a last crumbling surge and
the mighty swirl of water swept them up
the beach and their feet struck bottom.
Fortunately, the beach was not steep. The
tide was nearly at the last of the ebb and
there was but little undertow. Together
they waded out and staggered up the
shingle to sink down on the sand breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>The boxes were washing back and forth
at the water’s edge and Bill’s first act was
to haul them in.</p>

<p>“Well, the government’s precious loot
is safe,” he said grimly. “Are you able to
walk?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Then, let’s get going. We’ll freeze if
we don’t.”</p>

<p>He gathered up the boxes and looped
them from his shoulders, rose to his feet
and held out a hand. Dorothy took it,
scrambled up and stood for a moment
swaying unsteadily.</p>

<p>“The end of a perfect d-day—” she tried
to grin, her teeth chattering with cold.</p>

<p>“I <em>don’t</em> think!” replied Bill unenthusiastically,
and helped her to get rid of the
heavy life belt.</p>

<p>“Know where we are?” she inquired
when he had dropped the belts on the sand.</p>

<p>“Not precisely. But if we keep going
we ought to strike a lifesaving station or
something—come on.”</p>

<p>Dorothy groaned. “I suppose I must,
but—gee whiz—I sure want to rest.”</p>

<p>Bill, who knew that physical exertion
was absolutely necessary now, got his arm
about her and they started unsteadily down
the beach assisted by the gale at their backs.</p>

<p>They had walked about half a mile when
he felt her weight begin to increase and
her steps to lag. He stopped and peered
into her face. As he did so, she sank to
the sand at his feet. Bending over her, he
was surprised to see that she was asleep—utterly
exhausted.</p>

<p>The outlook was anything but pleasant.
They had apparently struck upon a wild
and desolate strip of sand—an island, he
thought, cut off by inlets at either end and
flanked by the maze of marshes in the lower
reaches of Great South Bay. Without
doubt they were marooned and to make
matters worse, Bill knew he had just about
reached the limit of his own strength.</p>

<h2 id='ch11' class='c007'><i>Chapter XI</i><br /><br />FROM OUT THE SEA</h2>

<p class='c006'>Bill stared down at Dorothy sleeping the
sleep of exhaustion on the cold, wet sand.
Her clothes, like his, were soaked with sea
water and with rain. He realized that
something must be done at once, or they
would both be in for pneumonia. So stripping
off his rubber coat and covering the
unconscious girl, he started for the dunes.</p>

<p>Day was breaking as he left the shingle
and commenced to plow through the loose
sand. The storm was abating somewhat.
Although the wind still blew half a gale,
the sleet had turned to a fine, cold rain
which bade fair to stop altogether once the
sun was fully up. By the time Bill Bolton
worked his painfully slow way to the top of
the dunes it was light enough to see for a
considerable distance.</p>

<p>At first glance the prospect was anything
but alluring. His point of vantage
was in the approximate center of an island
of sand and shingle, a mile long, perhaps,
by half a mile wide. Inlets from the white-capped
Atlantic effectually cut off escape
at either end of the outer beach on which a
fearsome surf was pounding. Along the
inner shore of this desolate, wind-swept islet
a complicated network of channels intertwined
about still other islands as far
as the eye would reach. Nor could Bill
make out any sign of human habitation.</p>

<p>“Water, water, everywhere, and not a
gol-darned drop to drink,” he misquoted
thoughtfully and wondered if by chewing
the eel grass he would be able to get rid of
the parched feeling of his mouth and throat.</p>

<p>He pulled a broad blade and chewed it
meditatively. Then spat it out in disgust.
The grass was as salty as the sea. It made
him thirstier than ever. Turning seaward
he swept the pale horizon with a despondent
gaze.</p>

<p>Not a sign of a craft of any description
could be seen. Wait a minute, though.
Bill caught his breath. What was that—bobbing
in the chop of the waves, just outside
the bar of the eastern inlet? Could it
be a boat? In this gray light a proper focus
was difficult. It was a boat, open; a lifeboat,
by the look of it. Waiting no longer
for speculation, he hurried down the low
hill toward the sea.</p>

<p>Once he struck hard sand, Bill raced into
the teeth of the wind, with the boom of
the surf on his right, and dire necessity
lending wings to his tired feet. Forgotten
were his thirst, the clammy cold of his wet
clothes and his weariness. Every ounce of
strength, the entire power of his will centered
in the effort to come close enough to
the boat to signal her assistance.</p>

<p>With his heart pumping like a steam engine,
he passed Dorothy, who was lying
exactly as he had left her. Then he got
his second wind and running became less
of a painful struggle. He could see the
boat more plainly now. Surely it was an
open motor sailor. Could it be the one belonging
to Donovan and Charlie, he wondered.
What irony!—to be rescued by the
smugglers—and to lose liberty and the diamonds
after all this storm and stress!</p>

<p>But the motor sailor was drifting—into
the surf off the bar—without a soul aboard.</p>

<p>Coming to a halt at the inlet, he watched
the tide pull the boat through the breakers
on the bar to the smooth water. Off came
his jacket and flinging it behind him on to
the sand he waded into the water and swam
for the boat. He reached her at last and
with difficulty pulled himself aboard.</p>

<p>For a moment or two he rested on a
thwart in a state of semi-collapse. As he
had thought, it was the smugglers’ boat.
But there was no sign of Donovan or Charlie.
However, except for six inches or so
of water that sloshed about his feet, the
motor sailor seemed to be in good condition.</p>

<p>When he felt better, he started the engine
and ran her ashore on the island. Then
after inspecting the boat’s lockers, he buried
her anchor in the sand and trudged
back along the beach to Dorothy.</p>

<p>She was still sleeping, tousled head pillowed
on her right arm, and it was some
time before he could bring her back to consciousness.</p>

<p>“Let me alone,” she moaned drowsily,
“I’m too tired to get up this morning, Lizzie.
I don’t want any breakfast—go away
and let me sleep!”</p>

<p>Bill raised her to a sitting position.
“Wake up—wake up! You aren’t at home.
And this isn’t Lizzie—it’s Bill—Bill Bolton!
We’re still on the island.”</p>

<p>Dorothy opened her eyes, and looked at
him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“The island—” he reiterated. “We
were wrecked—had to swim for it. Don’t
you remember?”</p>

<p>Suddenly she gained full control of her
waking senses.</p>

<p>“I know. I know now, Bill. Guess I’ve
been asleep. Ugh! I’m soaking. What
did you wake me for? At least, I was comfortable!”</p>

<p>“Come to breakfast and dry clothes.
You’ll get pneumonia if you stay here. Do
you think you can walk? You’re a pretty
husky armful, but I guess I can carry you
to the boat if I must.” He grinned at her.</p>

<p>Dorothy was stiff and weary but she
fairly jumped to her feet.</p>

<p>“What boat? Where is it?”</p>

<p>Bill told her.</p>

<p>“But you said ‘dry clothes and breakfast’—”</p>

<p>They were hurrying along the beach.</p>

<p>“That’s right. She’s got plenty of food
aboard—and one of the lockers is packed
with clothes. There are even dry towels,
think of that! Those guys had her provisioned
and equipped for a long trip.”</p>

<p>“What’s happened to them, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“I can’t make it out. The boat has
shipped some water, but nothing to be worried
about. The motor’s O.K. and there’s
plenty of gas. They may have got into the
surf, thought she was going to founder,
perhaps, and swam ashore like we did.”</p>

<p>“But they’re not on the island?”</p>

<p>“No. If they made the beach, it was
somewhere else along the coast.”</p>

<p>“We should worry,” said Dorothy. “If
they don’t want her, we do—and she certainly
looks good to me.”</p>

<p>They walked down the shingle and Bill
got aboard the boat.</p>

<p>“You wait on the beach,” he directed.
“It’s pretty wet underfoot. I’ll pass the
things overside. I think the best plan is for
you to go up in the dunes and change there.
Meanwhile, I’ll start in with the handpump
and get rid of the water. I’ll have
her good and dry by the time you get back.
Then you can rustle a meal while I put on
dry things. Catch!”</p>

<p>Dorothy found herself possessed of a
bundle knotted in a large bath towel. Upon
inspection it proved to contain dungaree
trousers, a jumper, a dark blue sweater,
woolen socks and a pair of rubber-soled
shoes.</p>

<p>“They may be a trifle large,” said Bill.
“But at least they’re dry and the clothes
seem to be clean.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could be sweeter,” was
Dorothy’s comment. “See you in ten minutes—so
long!”</p>

<p>“O.K.,” replied Bill and turned to the
handpump.</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour later he was completing
his labors with the aid of a large
sponge when he heard footsteps on the
shingle and looked up to see a young fellow
in blue dungarees and sweater coming
toward the boat, carrying a bundle of
clothes.</p>

<p>“Dorothy! Gee—what a change! For
a minute I thought you were a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s younger brother, I suppose,”
she laughed. “These things are
miles too big for me—but they’re darned
comfortable and warm. You go ahead
and change your own clothes. I’ll finish
bailing.”</p>

<p>Bill stepped overside and on to the sand,
carrying his dry rig and a towel. Dorothy
was spreading her sodden clothing on the
sand.</p>

<p>“Bailing’s over for today,” he told her,
“don’t forget about breakfast, though. I
could eat a raw whale.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, young feller,” she retorted.
“Your breakfast will be ready before
you are. Just let me get these things
drying in the nice warm sun that’s coming
up now, and you’ll see!”</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand he disappeared
over the brow of the sand hills, and
Dorothy clambered aboard the beached
motor sailor. Much to her delight she
found a small two-burner oil stove, already
lighted, standing on a thwart. Nearby had
been placed a coffee-pot and a large frying
pan. The lid of the food locker lay
open, as did the one containing the water
keg.</p>

<p>“Bright boy,” she murmured approvingly.
“You’re a real help to mother!
Now let’s see what smugglers live on.”</p>

<p>She had set a collapsible table that
hinged to the side of the boat and was busy
at the stove when she heard Bill’s halloo.</p>

<p>“Breakfast ready?” he called from the
beach.</p>

<p>“Will be in a jiffy,” she answered without
looking up. “How do you like your
eggs?”</p>

<p>“Sunny side up, if it’s all the same to
you.”</p>

<p>“O.K. Spread your wet clothes on the
sand and come aboard.”</p>

<p>She was serving his eggs on a hot plate
when Bill’s head appeared over the side.</p>

<p>“My, but that coffee smells good,” he
cried, and swung himself aboard. “How
did you manage to cook all that food!”</p>

<p>“Come to the table, and see what we’ve
got.”</p>

<p>He sat down and inspected the various
edibles, ticking them off on his fingers.</p>

<p>“Coffee, condensed milk, bread and
butter, the ham-what-am, fried eggs, marmalade
and maple syrup! Say, Dorothy,
those guys certainly lived high. Some
meal, this!”</p>

<p>Dorothy turned about from the stove,
smiling. “And here’s what goes with the
maple syrup!”</p>

<p>“A stack of wheats!” He shouted as
she uncovered the dish. “You’re a
wonder, a magician, Dorothy. How in
the world did you manage it?”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed, pleased by his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Found a package of pancake flour in
the locker. They’re simple enough to
make. Now dig in before things get cold.
Help yourself to butter—it’s rather soft,
but this lugger doesn’t seem to run to ice.”</p>

<p>Bill set to work as she poured the coffee.</p>

<p>“Like it that way,” he replied, his mouth
full of ham and eggs, while he plastered
his pancakes with butter. “Well, we’ve
sure put it over on Messrs. Donovan and
Charlie this trip, not to mention your
friend Peters. Got their diamonds and
their boat and their clothes. Now we’re
eating their breakfast,—the sun is shining
once more—and all is right in the world.”</p>

<p>“Where are those diamonds, by the
way?” exclaimed Dorothy suddenly, having
taken the edge off her ravenous appetite.</p>

<p>Bill laid down his knife and fork. For
a moment he looked startled, then burst
into a great roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“We’re a fine pair of Secret Service workers!”
he cried derisively. “But it’s my
fault. You were all in.”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s jaw dropped. “Don’t tell
me you left them on the beach!”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know. I left them beside
you on the sand and forgot all about
the darn things when I spotted the motor
sailor. Never thought of them again until
this minute!”</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded sagely. “Which only
goes to show that diamonds don’t count
for much when one is tired and wet and
hungry, not to mention being marooned
on a desert island!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it the truth! Another cup of
coffee, please. I’ll fetch them when we’ve
finished eating.”</p>

<p>“After we’ve washed up?”</p>

<p>“O.K. with me.”</p>

<p>Bill drank his third cup of coffee and
leaned back with a sigh of content.</p>

<p>“Well, the old appetite’s satisfied at last,”
he admitted comfortably. “And I don’t
mind telling you that was the best meal I
ever ate.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, kind sir. Though I think
it is your appetite rather than the cook you
should thank.”</p>

<p>Bill shook his head. “When it comes to
cooking, you’re a real, bona fide, died-in-the-wool,
A-1 Ace! How about it—shall
we wash the dishes now?”</p>

<p>“I can’t eat any more, and if I don’t get
busy soon, I’ll go to sleep again.”</p>

<p>“Pass the dishes and things overside to
me. I’ll sluice ’em off in the water. We
should worry. This will be our last meal
on this boat. I’ll bet a rubber nickel those
smuggler-guys wouldn’t have done this
much if they’d got the <i>Mary Jane</i>.”</p>

<p>“Poor <i>Mary Jane</i>,” sighed Dorothy as
they tidied up. “She was a staunch old
thing. I wonder what Yancy will soak
Dad for her?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Uncle Sam pays for that
boat. She went down on government service,
didn’t she?”</p>

<p>“That’s good news,” smiled Dorothy.
“Now, that’s the last plate. Let’s go along
the beach. I’m getting worried about
those boxes of diamonds. Do you think
they’ll be there, all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure to be. Unless somebody has
landed on this island while we were busy
with the eats. Come along and we’ll see.”</p>

<h2 id='ch12' class='c007'><i>Chapter XII</i><br /><br />THE NOTEBOOK</h2>

<p class='c006'>“Do you really think they’ll be where
we left them, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Why sure! You’re not worrying, are
you?”</p>

<p>The two were hurrying along the beach
toward the spot where Dorothy had
dropped to the sand and fallen asleep.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s Uncle Sam’s loot, not ours.
And I reckon he cares more about knowing
how the smuggling was done than the
contraband itself, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I know. But that’s only half of it. The
gang has got to be rounded up. We don’t
know where they have their headquarters
or who is in back of this business. So I’d
hate to have to admit I’d lost the diamonds,
after all.” Then, as Bill began to reply,
she went on: “And don’t forget that Terry
Walters is still missing—or was, when I
flew over from New Canaan yesterday!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, pal. I just didn’t want
you to take it too soberly. But that bearded
aviator has got to be checked up. No easy
matter, either, after what happened last
night.” He broke off sharply. “There
are the old boxes—just where I dropped
them—so you see you’ve had your worry
for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, we’ve been terribly careless!”</p>

<p>“Don’t rub it in,” said Bill, looping the
line and its dangling load over his
shoulder. “These things go to a bank for
safe keeping just as soon as I can get rid
of them.”</p>

<p>Dorothy caught his arm. “Let’s pry
open one of the boxes, and make sure
there really are diamonds inside.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” Bill answered decisively.
“They’re going to be turned over
to the authorities—as is!”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t be so snooty about
it. But I am crazy to see the sparklers—especially
after all we’ve been through to
rescue them!”</p>

<p>“Of course,—I’m sorry,” apologized
Bill with a grin, “I’m kind of jumpy this
morning, I guess. Me for bed as soon as
I can find one. But you know, we really
can’t open those things up, because we’d
then be held responsible for contents—or
no contents—as the case may be. See?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think about that, Bill. But let’s
forget the old boxes. I’m all in myself.
Any idea what time it is? My watch has
stopped.”</p>

<p>Bill glanced at his wrist. “Just seven
o’clock. Seems like noon to me. This nice
warm sun is a wonderful help—I was
chilled to the bone.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” said Dorothy. “Well, here
we are at the motor sailor. Nothing to
keep us longer on this island. I vote we
shove off.”</p>

<p>“Second the motion. Hop aboard and
go aft. Your weight in the stern will help
to raise her bow so I can push her out without
breaking my back.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” called Dorothy a minute
later.</p>

<p>“Fine! Stand by for a shove!”</p>

<p>A heave of his shoulder against the bow
loosened the boat’s keel from the sand and
Bill sprang aboard as she glided into deep
water.</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose there’s a chart of the
lower bay stowed in one of those lockers?”
he remarked as he started the engine. “The
shallows are going to be the limit to navigate
without running aground. Do you
mind seeing what you can find, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Not at all—seeing I’ve already found
one,” she laughed. “Came across it when
I was looking for food.”</p>

<p>“Good.” Bill took over the wheel. “Let
me see it, will you?”</p>

<p>Dorothy passed over the map. Bill
studied it with a hand on the wheel.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness the deeper channels
are marked,” he ruminated, “that’s a help,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Dorothy peered over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“That island must be one of those in
Jones Inlet. I had no idea we’d gone so
far west.”</p>

<p>“All of fifteen miles as a plane flies to
Babylon. No chance of making any time
until we get into South Oyster Bay which
is really the western end of Great South
Bay. If we make Babylon by noon, we’ll
be lucky.”</p>

<p>“No reason why we should both try to
keep awake,” observed Dorothy. “I’ll
skipper this craft for a spell. Make yourself
comfortable somewhere and go to
sleep. You’ll be called at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“But you need rest more than I do,” began
Bill.</p>

<p>“Oh, I had a snooze on the <i>Mary Jane</i>,”
she interrupted, “and got another on the
sand this morning. Pipe down, sailor!
This is your master’s voice what’s speaking.
Excuse the ungarnished truth, but
you look like something the cat brought
in and didn’t want!”</p>

<p>Bill’s laugh ended in a yawn.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, skipper. Call me at four
bells. Night!”</p>

<p>He went forward and lay flat on the
flooring, his head pillowed on his arms.
He was asleep almost immediately.</p>

<p>For the next couple of hours Dorothy
steered a winding course among low sandy
islands and mudbanks. It was impossible
to make any speed in these shallow, tortuous
waters and she was taking no chances
on running aground. It was monotonous
work at best. She was deadly tired. There
was little or no breeze and the sun, unshaded
by the faintest wisp of cloud,
fairly blistered the boat’s paint with its
fierce heat.</p>

<p>At ten she roused Bill, and as soon as
he was sufficiently alert to take over she
went to sleep on the flooring in the shadow
of a thwart.</p>

<p>It seemed as though she had but closed
her eyes when Bill’s voice called her back
to wakefulness.</p>

<p>“We’re almost in,” he reminded her.
“Better run forward or I’m likely to ram
the dock.”</p>

<p>Dorothy jumped to her feet and ran
her fingers through her rumpled hair. She
was astonished to see that the motor sailor
was closing in on the dock of Yancy’s
Motor Boat garage.</p>

<p>“We must have made wonderful time—”
she yawned, stumbling toward the bow.</p>

<p>“Only fair,” Bill said. “It’s almost
noon. Snap into it, kid, and fend her off
with the boathook.”</p>

<p>Presently they were tied up to the dock
and Dorothy was making a sketchy toilet
with the aid of her compact.</p>

<p>“How about it, old sport?” she looked
up from her mirror, busy with damp
powder and lipstick. “What’s on the
program now? Thank goodness <i>Wispy</i>
is still at her mooring over there. I s’pose
after we settle with Yancy for the <i>Mary
Jane</i>, we’d better take the plane and fly
home.”</p>

<p>“Eventually, yes,” decided Bill. “I’ll
go up to the office and fix things with
Yancy. I’ve got to do some long distance
telephoning, anyway, and park these boxes
in a bank. It will save a lot of time if you’ll
go over this boat with a fine tooth comb
while I’m gone. I don’t expect you’ll find
anything much, but there’s no telling.”</p>

<p>“All right,” she nodded. “And while
you’re about it, get hold of that letter I
wrote Mr. Walters and phone Lizzy we
will be home for a late lunch. The sooner
we can get back to New Canaan and Little
Dorothy can crawl between clean sheets,
the better she’ll be pleased!”</p>

<p>“Yep. I’ll work as fast as I can.”</p>

<p>Bill clambered on to the dock and made
off in the direction of the boat yard.</p>

<p>For the next hour Dorothy worked manfully,
overhauling the motor sailor. Fierce
rays of the noonday sun beat down on the
open boat. She was worn out and dizzy,
but stuck pluckily to her job, turning out
the contents of lockers and investigating
every nook and cranny of the smugglers’
craft. Except for an old coat and those
odds and ends which accumulate aboard
any boat as large as the motor sailor, she
found absolutely nothing. Tired and hot
and crazy for sleep, she decided to call off
this unprofitable search, when Bill’s voice
hailed her.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, pardner,” he sang out,
stepping aboard. “How are things going?”</p>

<p>Dorothy straightened her back and
wiped the perspiration from her forehead
with a sodden handkerchief. She noted
the deep circles below Bill’s eyes and the
tired droop of his shoulders. He looked
on the verge of collapse, but his voice still
held its hearty ring.</p>

<p>“Not so good, old timer. There isn’t
a blessed thing worth while aboard this
scow. Finish your business?”</p>

<p>“Reckon so. Got Washington on the
phone and the big chief is tickled silly with
all we’ve done. Tell you more about it
later. Yancy will be recompensed for
the <i>Mary Jane</i> and will look after this
motor sailor until the government men
take her over. I got Lizzie on the wire.
She expects your father home tonight.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Did you get my letter, too?”</p>

<p>“It’s in my pocket. I put the diamonds
in a safe deposit box at a bank uptown.
And I guess that’s pretty much everything.”</p>

<p>“You look done up, Bill.”</p>

<p>“I’ve felt sprucer. But you look pretty
rocky yourself.”</p>

<p>“Feel like a wet smack, thank you. The
heat is terrible.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I collect my duds and yours,”
he suggested, “and we’ll beat it for New
Canaan and Home Sweet Home!”</p>

<p>“They’re rolled up in a sea bag,” she
told him. “Here it is.”</p>

<p>She started toward him with the bag
in her arms, stumbled and would have
fallen had not Bill’s steadying hand prevented.</p>

<p>“Kind o’ wobbly, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not as bad as all that, Bill. Caught
my toe in that floorboard. It’s loose.”</p>

<p>“Have you had them up?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>Bill took the sea bag from her and tossed
it on to the dock.</p>

<p>“Hop on a thwart,” he prompted. “I
don’t suppose there’s anything but bilgewater
under the boards but we might as
well have a look.”</p>

<p>“Need a hand?” asked Dorothy, looking
down at him.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. These sections aren’t
heavy—” He broke off with a sudden exclamation
and fished up something from
the wet.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Seems to be a notebook. Probably
dropped out of either Donovan’s or
Charlie’s pockets and got kicked under
that loose flooring in the gale last night.
But it’s soaking wet and its pages are stuck
together. Wonder if we’ll be able to get
anything out of it?”</p>

<p>Dorothy held out her hand.</p>

<p>“Give it to me. I’ll dry it out on the
dock while you look some more.”</p>

<p>For the next few minutes Bill continued
his search while Dorothy after placing the
notebook on the decking of the dock
watched it carefully, lest the light breeze
blow it into the water.</p>

<p>At last he joined her and lifted the sea
bag over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“How’s it coming?”</p>

<p>“Not so good. It’s going to take a long
time to dry the book all the way through
even in this sun.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s take it along to New Canaan.
I’ll get Dad to put it in our oven as soon as
we get home. That’ll do the trick. Get
aboard that dinghy and I’ll row you over to
the plane.”</p>

<p>Dorothy picked up the notebook and
slipped it into her pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s the best thing you’ve said today,”
she beamed, “I’ll be home and asleep in
twenty minutes! Come along.”</p>

<h2 id='ch13' class='c007'><i>Chapter XIII</i><br /><br />THE WARNING</h2>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy and Mr. Dixon were finishing
breakfast next morning when the Boltons,
father and son, dropped in.</p>

<p>“Good morning, stranger,” was Mr.
Dixon’s greeting to Bill. “I understand
you’ve been to Europe and back a couple
of times since we saw you last. We’ve
missed you, boy.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned Bill. “I’m glad to
be home again.”</p>

<p>“Which home?” asked his father with
an amused smile. “When in New Canaan
you seem to spend most of your time across
the way here.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” protested Mr. Dixon.
“Dorothy and I return the compliment
often enough. Since you people moved
here two lonely widowers have acquired
another child apiece. It’s fine—both Dorothy
and I are the happier for it.”</p>

<p>“And that goes two ways,” asserted Bill.
“How about it, Dad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” Mr. Bolton assented
heartily. “The intimacy is one I enjoy immensely.
But I’m afraid that Bill has begun
the habit of leading Dorothy into all
kinds of dangerous adventures. This diamond
smuggling business, for instance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon chuckled. “If you ask me,
I don’t think Dorothy needs any leading.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not!” exclaimed his
daughter. “If it weren’t for Bill, I’d never
be able to get out of half the messes we drift
into together!”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon pushed his chair back from
the breakfast table. “This meeting of the
mutual admiration society is all very nice,”
he announced with a twinkle in his eye,
“But it is high time the ways and means
committee got together on this last Bolton-Dixon
hair-raiser. I vote we adjourn to
the porch and learn what the subcommittee
on the smugglers’ notebook has
to report.”</p>

<p>“Second the motion,” chirped Dorothy.
“I’m just crazy to hear what you’ve found
out, Daddy Bolton. I suppose Bill has
been hitting the hay, like me?”</p>

<p>“He put in nearly sixteen hours of uninterrupted
slumber,” Mr. Bolton answered
as they found chairs for themselves
on the shaded porch, where the air was
sweet with the scent of honeysuckle.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it was a dead heat,” she
laughed. “I woke up less than an hour
ago, myself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon passed his case to Mr. Bolton
and when their after-breakfast cigars
were well alight, Bill produced the notebook.</p>

<p>“While you’re busy with that stogie,
Dad, I’ll start the ball rolling.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That—er—stogie happens
to be a fifty-cent Corona!” snorted Mr.
Dixon who was touchy about his smokes.</p>

<p>“Means nothing to me,” replied Bill
blandly. “Don’t use ’em myself and—”</p>

<p>“Say, will you please pipe down on
cigars—” broke in Dorothy, “and get to
the notebook?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a pun—” groaned Bill, “you
certainly—”</p>

<p>“Be still!” ordered his father. “She’s
right. Let’s get down to business. Now,
here’s the book,” he went on, opening the
little volume. “I dried it in our oven and
although the writing is blurred, it is still
quite legible. As you see, only a few pages
have been used, and they show a simple
set of flag signals. The red flag means:
‘Meet Steamship.’ The yellow flag stands
for ‘<span class='sc'>A.M.</span>’; the white, ‘<span class='sc'>P.M.</span>’ Then there
are twenty-four flags to designate the hours
and half-hours from one to twelve.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Dorothy, disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Absolutely. The rest of the pages are
blank.”</p>

<p>“I remember hearing the men speak of
the bosses’ red flag when I was listening
outside the cottage,” she said slowly, “and
that meant, of course, that Donovan and
Charlie were to meet the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Quite. But until we are able to locate
the spot where these signals are displayed
we won’t accomplish much.”</p>

<p>Bill nodded. “And now that they know
we have discovered their method of smuggling,
they’ll probably shift their operations
from Fire Island Lightship to some
other point along the coast.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” his father acquiesced.
“Although it is my opinion they will discontinue,
temporarily, and lay low for a
while.”</p>

<p>“Still there must be other shipments in
transit right now,” suggested Mr. Dixon.
“But I suppose they could manage that by
sending radios in code?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton carefully knocked the ash
from his cigar.</p>

<p>“I think that’s beyond the point,” he
argued. “We can only surmise what they
may or may not do. The government men
will watch the ships and the coast. Both
Bill and I talked to Washington over the
phone just before we came over here. And
the officials there believe that the bearded
aviator’s plane is a most important factor
in the operations of the smugglers. And
the Chief wants Bill to find that plane—”</p>

<p>Dorothy snorted derisively. “Well, he
doesn’t want much! That airplane won’t
fly over the Beach Club again, after this—”</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton smiled at Dorothy’s vehemence.
“But you see, my dear, the Washington
gentleman thinks that if Bill is able
to follow the mysterious amphibian, it will
eventually lead him to the headquarters of
the gang.”</p>

<p>Bill burst out laughing. “It’s just like
telling me to take a handful of salt—and
if I can put it on the birdie’s tail, I will
eventually catch the birdie! But it isn’t
really the Chief’s order, he knows what
we’re up against. It’s that assistant of his
who wants to cover himself with glory. I
asked him if I hadn’t better disguise my
plane like a string of white boxes so they’d
take me for a diamond necklace!”</p>

<p>“What’d he say?” giggled Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Oh, he spread on the soft soap until
I got even more disgusted and turned him
over to Dad!”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon chuckled. “It’s a pretty
large order. I don’t suppose your Secret
Service friend gave you any valuable suggestions?”</p>

<p>“He did not,” sneered Bill. “That, as
he explained, was entirely up to me!”</p>

<p>For several minutes no one spoke.</p>

<p>“We sure are up against it,” sighed
Dorothy at last.</p>

<p>“You mean I am,” was Bill’s reply.
“The only thing I can do is to start a series
of patrols.”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> will start a series of patrols,” she
corrected. “Two planes will be better than
one.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say.” Bill showed no enthusiasm.
“My idea of something uninteresting
to do is to fly around all day, hunting
another plane, that’s probably safely
housed in its hangar all the time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be such a wet blanket! If
none of us have brains enough to think of
a plan to trap that fellow, there’s no use
grouching over it!”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well. But where are
we going to patrol? You told me, I think,
that those lads planned to take you from
the warehouse to their headquarters in
Connecticut. This state’s not so big when
you compare it with Texas or California—but
when it comes to locating a single
plane—”</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Dorothy and ran to the
porch steps. “Come here—all of you—quick!”</p>

<p>The deep drone of an airplane increased
to a giant roar as a smart two-seater swept
down toward the house.</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>Mystery Plane</i>!” she shrieked.
“The nerve of him!”</p>

<p>On came the amphibian with throttle
wide open, just topping the trees at the
edge of the lawn. Then the four on the
steps saw the pilot drop something overside
and zoom upward missing the roof
of the house by inches.</p>

<p>“I should say he has nerve—” Mr.
Dixon pointed out on to the lawn. “Run
out and get that parcel he dropped on the
grass, Bill. This business is getting more
interesting by the minute!”</p>

<p>Bill brought the package back to the
porch.</p>

<p>“Oh, what do you think it is?” Dorothy
grabbed Bill’s arm in her excitement.</p>

<p>“Calm down!” said her father, as Bill
held out a small box covered with brown
paper and sealed with dabs of red wax.
“Handle it carefully—there may be explosive
in it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so—” said Bill, “those
things generally run by clockwork.
There’s no tick in this box.”</p>

<p>“Come on—let’s open it,” exclaimed
Dorothy impatiently. “I’ll bet it’s nothing
dangerous. Couldn’t have been dropped
from a plane without going off!”</p>

<p>“Wait one minute,” commanded her
father. “We’ll be on the safe side, anyway.
Don’t touch the thing till I come
back.”</p>

<p>He ran into the house.</p>

<p>“Any address on it?” inquired Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest bit of writing. If
there is any, it’s underneath this outside
wrapping.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon came out of the house carrying
a pail of water, which he brought
down to the lawn, where they were waiting.</p>

<p>“Drop that package into the water,” he
ordered Bill. “A good soaking will take
the sting out of any explosive.”</p>

<p>Dorothy burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Maybe—but not in this case, Dad.
Look, the thing floats!”</p>

<p>She snatched up the package and ripped
off the outside paper, disclosing a white
cork box, similar to those used for carrying
the contraband.</p>

<p>Bill took a knife from his pocket and
opened a blade that proved to be a small
screwdriver. He took the box from Dorothy
and removed the screws from the lid.</p>

<p>“Gee, do you think they’ve sent us a diamond?”
she asked jokingly.</p>

<p>“Not a chance. This is a message of
some kind, I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>The box was filled with jeweler’s cotton,
from the center of which he drew a revolver
cartridge. Around it, fastened by a rubber
band, there was a small sheet of note paper.
The others gathered close as he smoothed
out the paper.</p>

<p>Blocked in capitals with a red crayon
was the smugglers’ message.</p>

<p>“LAY OFF! THIS MEANS BOTH
OF YOU.”</p>

<p>“Aha! And if we don’t lay off, we’ll be
plunked with a bullet from a cartridge like
this!” Dorothy summed up. “This affair
is likely to get exciting before we finish it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton studied the paper then returned
it to the box with the cartridge.</p>

<p>“Has it struck you oddly,” he said
quietly, “that these people should know
that Bill was mixed up in this? That message,
of course, is for Dorothy and Bill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was thinking of that,” admitted
Bill.</p>

<p>“Strange—” cogitated Mr. Dixon.
“You two flew from Babylon back here
without a stop—and you both went straight
to bed. Neither you, nor I, Bolton, have
spoken to anyone about their exploits, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>“Somebody must have found out from
the servants that our offspring flew back together,”
his friend decided. “It could not
have happened any other way. Then that
fact, added to the glimpse they must have
caught of a young man in the <i>Mary Jane</i>
with Dorothy, when they rammed the
smugglers’ motor sailor off the lightship,
gave them a simple line of reasoning.
And the joke of the matter is that their
warning has done just the reverse from
what they figured it would do!”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, it has given us the only real clue
we have to the gang’s whereabouts,” smiled
Bolton senior.</p>

<p>“Dad’s one up on me, too,” grinned Bill.
“How about you, Dot?”</p>

<p>Miss Dixon stamped her foot. “You’ll
<em>dot</em>, and carry one you’ll remember for the
rest of your life if you murder my perfectly
decent name that way, Bill! You ought to
know by now that I won’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>“So sorry, Dorothy!” he apologized
with mock politeness. “Will Miss Sherlock
Holmes, the famous lady sleuthhound
who solved the New Canaan Bank mystery,
deign to say whether or not she also
spots a clue in the villain’s message?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the bunk! Yes, I think I
know what Daddy Bolton is talking
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Cleverness, what is it
then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me tired! But just to
prove that I’m not as dumb as you act, the
clue is this—”</p>

<p>“Give me a chance,” begged Mr. Dixon,
entering into the spirit of the game. “Your
idea, Bolton, is to find out from the servants
who they’ve been talking to and trace the
smugglers from—”</p>

<p>“Cold as an iceberg,” broke in Mr. Bolton.
“I’m sorry to admit it, but you and
Bill don’t seem very quick on the uptake
this morning. What do I mean, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>Dorothy made a face at Bill.</p>

<p>“We know that these men have headquarters
somewhere in this state,” she began
airily. “Why? Because Donovan
said they must get me over to Connecticut.
And later, in the warehouse, he told Peters
not to rob me because the boss wanted me
delivered just as I was. Daddy Bolton believes
that because these men have been spotted
so quickly that <em>you</em> are mixed up in it, Bill,
their headquarters are much nearer to this
house than we figured: that the chances
are, it is only a very few miles from here
that they’re to be found—or their system of
spying on us couldn’t be so perfect!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” concurred Mr. Bolton.
“This smuggler boss or his accomplices
over here must live in the neighborhood.
Some of his servants know ours—have
known them for some time or they would
not have been able to ask questions without
causing suspicion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon looked suddenly serious.
“You can’t mean that our neighbors along
this ridge are mixed up in it? The Clarks,
old Holloway, the Denbys, Miss Cross—and
ten or a dozen others—are all old
friends and eminently respectable people!
Why, it’s preposterous to think—”</p>

<p>“I’m not trying to pin it on anybody
yet,” countered Bill’s father. “But mark
my words—when this business is cleared
up, you’ll find that some eminently respectable
New Canaan household <em>is</em> mixed up
in it!”</p>

<h2 id='ch14' class='c007'><i>Chapter XIV</i><br /><br />UP AGAINST IT</h2>

<p class='c006'>It was finally decided that Dorothy and
Bill should make a series of circular
patrols, centering above New Canaan.</p>

<p>“We’ll each take a plane,” said Bill,
“and keep each other in sight.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of doing that?” Dorothy
asked. “Why not make the patrols
separately? When I come down, you go
up. In that way we can stay in the air
twice as long on the same amount of gas,
and take a rest once in a while.”</p>

<p>“Too risky. These smugglers are desperate.
We’ve already thrown a good-sized
monkey-wrench into the works of their
organization. That <i>Mystery Plane</i> is quite
likely to pack along a machine gun—and
use it if the pilot finds out we’re trying to
follow him.”</p>

<p>“Are we going up unarmed?”</p>

<p>“You are—but I’m not.”</p>

<p>Dorothy raised her eyebrows in surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s nice of you!”</p>

<p>“Look here, young lady,” cut in her
father. “I don’t know what Bill’s plans
are, but if you’re going on these patrols,
just remember that he is the captain of the
outfit and must have obedience. Otherwise,
I’ll not consent to your going at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be good, Daddy. But I do
think—”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t! Your job is to do
what you’re told and let your captain do
the thinking.”</p>

<p>“You see, Dorothy,” explained Bill,
“in order to use a gun in the air, a pilot
must have training and practice. Otherwise,
all you do is to draw the enemy’s fire.
If we meet up with this bird you’ll have
plenty to keep you busy—a very important
part to play. But if there’s any gunning
to be done, I’ll do it. Before we go
up, I’ll outline exactly what we’re to do
in the event we sight the gang’s airplane.”</p>

<p>Dorothy got out of her chair.</p>

<p>“How about getting busy, then?” she
suggested. “The longer we’re up, the
more we are likely to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” laughed Bill.
“Don’t think for a minute we’re going to
patrol all day long.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Waste of time.”</p>

<p>Dorothy plumped herself down in her
chair again.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Have it your way. Personally,
I can’t see doing a thing at all, unless
one does it properly. You and your
plans make me tired.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get peeved,” he bantered. “These
won’t be endurance flights.”</p>

<p>“They won’t be anything at all unless
we find that plane and you can’t expect it
to take the air just when you want it to!”</p>

<p>“Stop quarreling, children,” admonished
her father. “Bill knows what he is
talking about.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he does. He can catch
the old plane by himself. I’m through.”</p>

<p>“What you need is another nap, young
lady. You’re tired and cross.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. Men always club together.”</p>

<p>“And what can a poor girl do?” supplemented
Bill with a grin.</p>

<p>“Stop teasing, Bill!” commanded Mr.
Bolton. “Apologize to Dorothy and tell her
why you mean to take short hops. I can’t
see the sense in such procedure myself—any
more than she can. And just remember
that an overdose of excitement puts
anybody’s nerves on edge. She’s been
through a lot more than you have during
the last few days.”</p>

<p>At his father’s words, Bill’s face wore
such a look of honest contrition, that Dorothy’s
conscience smote her. They both
began to speak at once.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’m sorry, Dorothy—”</p>

<p>“I’m an idiot, Bill—”</p>

<p>They burst into laughter simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Now we can get on with our discussion,”
smiled Dorothy. “Go ahead, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Well, the smuggler’s pilot has been
taking most of his flights—or I ought to
say, the flights we know about—during the
late afternoon. I haven’t the slightest
glimmer why he chooses to fly at that
time. But, as I see it, if he has done it day
after day in the past, the chances are he’ll
continue to leave his hangar at about the
same time. My plan is for us to take off
at about four each afternoon. We can remain
in the air until six. If he comes from
around here, we’d catch him shortly after
he takes the air. That’s how I figure it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right.” Dorothy was
still unconvinced. “But how about the
warning we got a little while ago?”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Well, we hadn’t had lunch yet—he
dropped the message from his plane in the
morning—not during the late afternoon!”</p>

<p>Bill yawned unblushingly and got to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Cuts no ice,” he asserted. “That
wasn’t a regular hop.”</p>

<p>“What then?” This from Mr. Dixon.</p>

<p>“A grandstand play, pure and simple.
Those lads haven’t the brains I gave them
credit for, if they really think they can
steer us off with tripe like that!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton ground the butt of his cigar
on an ashtray, and rose.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that wasn’t the idea,” he suggested.</p>

<p>Three heads were turned sharply toward
him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Bolton?” asked
Mr. Dixon.</p>

<p>“A come-on,” returned his neighbor.</p>

<p>“A come-on?” echoed Dorothy in a
puzzled voice.</p>

<p>“Just that—nothing more nor less.”</p>

<p>“I get you,” Bill nodded. “Get us in
the air, by that teaser—rely on us to go
after the <i>Mystery Plane</i> as a matter of
pride—and then fill us full of machine gun
bullets. If they start anything like that—well—two
can play the game and if that
lad with the beard can’t shoot any better
than he handled his plane when he zoomed
the house just now—it is, as the French say,
‘to laugh’!”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” argued Mr.
Dixon. “I don’t mind Dorothy flying, but
I do draw the line at machine guns. That’s
no game for girls. You keep your two feet
on solid earth until this business is over,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy!” Dorothy’s voice was full
of disgust.</p>

<p>“Sorry, daughter, but I simply can’t let
you take the risk.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton placed his hand on his
friend’s arm.</p>

<p>“You know, I don’t think that Bill
would have countenanced Dorothy’s going
on patrols with him unless he felt assured
she would run no danger. How
about it, son?”</p>

<p>“If she does get into trouble, it won’t
be with my consent,” he smiled. “But seriously,
sir,” he turned to Mr. Dixon. “There
will be a minimum of danger if Dorothy
does as I tell her. In the first place, machine
gun fire in the air is not nearly so
potent as it is on terra firma. Try and hit
a small object flashing by when you’re
traveling like a bat out of—ahem!—Harlem.
Try it and see how many planes you
don’t hit! And in the second place, that
bearded guy won’t get a chance to turn
his gun in her direction.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m no flyer and I haven’t the
slightest idea of the technicalities that must
arise in aerial combat work,” Mr. Dixon
made this statement slowly and thoughtfully,
“but still—”</p>

<p>“Daddy, <em>don’t</em> be ridic.” Dorothy’s
tone was tolerantly amused.</p>

<p>“Do you really think I’m foolish, my
dear child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pigheaded is a better word, at
times, if you insist on the truth!”</p>

<p>All four burst into roars of mirth.</p>

<p>“That’s one from the shoulder, Mr.
Dixon,” choked Bill. “You’d better go the
whole hog, now she’s a licensed pilot!”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s father shook his head in pretended
sorrow. “You’re all against me,
that’s obvious. And there’s much too much
pig in this conversation to suit a conservative
parent.” He threw an affectionate
glance at Dorothy. “Ever since this tomboy
daughter of mine was able to grip my
finger when I leaned over her crib, she has
pulled her old Dad hither and yon to suit
her fancy. So I suppose I’ll have to give
in again—acknowledge I’m wrong, and
so forth. Run along, children, and see to
it your airships are in apple-pie order.”</p>

<p>“You’re a darling!” His daughter bestowed
a hearty kiss upon his left ear.</p>

<p>“Beat it—you scamp!” Mr. Dixon’s
voice was gruff, though his eyes sparkled
with merriment. “If you bother me much
longer, it will be lunch time before I get
down to the bank—and I’m likely to
change my mind. Shoo!”</p>

<p>“Ogre—I defy you!” With a laugh, she
beckoned to Bill and ran down the steps.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall it be?” she inquired
when he joined her. “Your ship or mine,
first?”</p>

<p>“Mine, I think. None of the three has
been off the apron of the hangar since I
left for Europe. Frank has been looking
after them. He’s a great old feller, you
know. When we brought him back from
New York he didn’t know a fork from a
gadget. Now he’s chauffeur, general factotem
around the house, and practical mechanic
for me. He knows his job all right,
but my boats will need more overhauling
than yours.”</p>

<p>“Which plane shall you use for this
work?”</p>

<p>“The Ryan M-l, that the bank gave me
after that Martinelli business. She certainly
is a smart little bus—can fly rings
around anything in this neck of the woods.
Hello—” he broke off as they came down
the drive, “somebody’s had a breakdown.”</p>

<p>Drawn up at the side of the ridge road
stood a green coupe of the type motor car
manufacturers advertise as “de luxe
model.” As they came in sight, a young
man crawled out from beneath the body.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s Mr. Tracey,” said Dorothy.
“Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I met him at Mr. Holloway’s
house one night. Isn’t he the old boy’s
secretary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. He’s quite nice. Dad sees
a lot of Mr. Holloway, you know.”</p>

<p>The secretary, tall and sleekly blond, was
looking ruefully down at his grey flannel
trousers, now streaked with the dirt of the
roadway.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Dorothy,” he
greeted, clipping his words in a precise
manner. “Afraid I’m not exactly presentable.”
Then for the first time, he appeared
to notice Bill. “Hello, Bolton,” he said
affably. “You’re quite a stranger around
here.”</p>

<p>“Got back a couple of days ago,” returned
Bill casually. “Need any help?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no. Loose nut, that’s all.”
He patted his monkey wrench with a grimy
hand. “This fixed her. Doing much flying,
Miss Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I go up quite often. Bill taught
me, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember. I’d like to take lessons,
myself. How about giving me instruction—that
is, if you’re not too expensive?”</p>

<p>“I’m really not in the business,” parried
Bill. “You’d do much better at one of the
schools. Glad to give you a hop, though,
if you’d like to go up?”</p>

<p>“Thanks so much. I’ll be glad to take
advantage of your offer. What about this
afternoon? It’s a perfectly lovely day.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but today I’m overhauling my
planes. Been away some time, you see.
I’ll probably take them up on tests about
four. But of course I don’t want the responsibility
of a passenger until I know
they are running O.K.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tracey nodded and got into his car.</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly. Thanks for
the invitation, though. I’ll give you a ring
later in the week and allow myself the pleasure
of going up with you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Miss Dorothy.”</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand the car moved
off and Dorothy turned to Bill.</p>

<p>“Why did you tell him you were going
to take the air about four?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Because if the smuggling gang know
what I’m going to do it will save time if
we pull off our little scrap this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Before this admission Dorothy had
looked puzzled. Now her eyebrows went
up in startled astonishment.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens, Bill! You surely don’t
think that Mr. Tracey has anything to do
with that! He’s as prim and prissy as a
pussy-cat!”</p>

<p>“Just my opinion. Of course he knows
nothing about the diamonds. But your
prissy boy friend has the reputation of being
the worst gossip in New Canaan. When
he takes those gray bags of his to be
cleaned, it will be all over the village that
Bill Bolton is back and intends to test out
his planes late this afternoon.—And that is
just what I want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” Dorothy nodded thoughtfully.
“But I’ll tell you one thing. If we
are going up today, it’s high time we quit
talking and got busy on the planes.”</p>

<p>With four airplanes to groom, the next
few hours proved busy ones for both Dorothy
and Bill. But by four o’clock everything
was ready for their flight.</p>

<p>“Got your instructions down pat?” he
inquired as Dorothy got aboard the <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>.
The airplane was resting on
the concrete apron of the Dixons’ hangar,
preparatory to the take off.</p>

<p>“Know them backwards,” she flashed
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Good luck, then.”</p>

<p>“Good luck to you, Bill.”</p>

<p>He stepped swiftly to one side as she
switched on the ignition. For a moment
or two he stood there watching her amphibian
taxi away from the hangar, gathering
speed as it went. Then when the wheels
left the ground and the big bird of wood
and metal soared upward, he turned away
and made off in the direction of his father’s
property.</p>

<p>As <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> climbed in great
widening circles, Dorothy at the controls
knew she had plenty of time to gain the
position agreed upon before Bill could get
under way. The air was smooth and still,
without the slightest breath of disturbing
wind. Perfect flying weather and wonderful
visibility with a clear blue horizon unmarred
by the smallest shred of cloud.</p>

<p>The Boltons had turned the ten-acre pasture
behind their house into a level flying
field. The old hay barn had been enlarged,
partitions removed and a concrete floor
laid. It now made a large roomy hangar,
for their three planes.</p>

<p>Looking down as she kept on circling
higher and higher, Dorothy saw Bill cross
the ridge road and appear a moment or
two later on his own flying field. She
watched him hurry down to the hangar and
could see Frank busy about the Ryan before
its open doors. Then she saw Bill
get aboard. When she looked again, his
small monoplane was already in the air.</p>

<p>By this time the indicator on <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp’s</i>
altimeter marked a height of
between eight and nine thousand feet. According
to instructions, Dorothy leveled
off and bringing right rudder and right
aileron simultaneously into play, she sent
the plane into a wide circular turn. Far
below, the Ryan was pursuing the same
tactics, so that both planes were cruising
over the township of New Canaan.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Bill continued to maintain
the same relative positions for the next fifteen
or twenty minutes. Then as <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
swung round toward the west,
Dorothy spied a third plane, streaking toward
New Canaan at an altitude of some
three thousand feet.</p>

<p>The fact that Bill had also spotted the
intruder was evident, for he began to climb.</p>

<p>“Bill’s advertising plan worked,” muttered
Dorothy with satisfaction. “If that
amphibian over there isn’t the <i>Mystery
Plane</i>, I’ll eat my ailerons!”</p>

<h2 id='ch15' class='c007'><i>Chapter XV</i><br /><br />RUN TO COVER</h2>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy reached beneath her seat,
brought forth a pair of field-glasses and
clapped them to her goggles. Focussed
through the powerful lenses, there was no
mistaking the <i>Mystery Plane</i>. And although
at this distance it was impossible to
see the pilot’s face, she could plainly distinguish
the barrel of a machine gun that
poked its wicked muzzle over the cockpit’s
cowling.</p>

<p>“So the bearded aviator means mischief!”
She returned the glasses to their
case. “That guy must be a cold-blooded
dog to try anything like that over a populated
township. He’s likely to bite off more
than he can chew if Bill and I have any
luck. If he cracks up, I shan’t weep.”</p>

<p>At first sight of the smuggler’s plane,
she brought <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> back on an
even keel, but now in order to get an unimpeded
view directly below, she sent the
plane into a steep bank.</p>

<p>Bill, in the Ryan, with an altitude of
some twenty-five hundred feet and its nose
slightly raised was streaking toward the
smuggler.</p>

<p>Most air battles are fought in the higher
ether, because combat flying often necessitates
acrobatics and the ordinary pilot
wants plenty of air below for such work.
The smuggler being the aggressor in this
case, naturally started to climb when he
spotted the Ryan. He hoped, no doubt,
not only to increase his altitude but to gain
greater ascendency over Bill before diving
at the monoplane with his machine gun
going full blast.</p>

<p>It was time for Dorothy to act. As the
smuggler’s plane began to ascend, she sent
her amphibian diving toward him at a tremendous
spurt of speed. The <i>Mystery
Plane</i> nosed over and dove in turn at the
Ryan, some five hundred feet below.</p>

<p>“Ha-ha!” Dorothy shut off her motor
and brought <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp’s</i> nose gradually
back to the horizontal. “Our scheme
worked! That bird either doesn’t know
his business or he’s lost his nerve!”</p>

<p>A fighting plane attacking has as its objective
a position directly behind the hostile
plane at close range. A position either
above or below the tail is equally good.
From these positions the enemy is directly
in the line of fire, and in sighting no deflection
is necessary.</p>

<p>The smuggler’s maneuver showed
Dorothy that he was a novice; for instead
of going into a climbing spiral which
would have eluded her dive and made it
possible for him to attain a superior position
over both planes, he dove at the Ryan.
This might have been a proper fighting
maneuver if Bill’s plane had not been
nosing upward toward him; and had the
Ryan not been the faster of the two.</p>

<p>By this blunder he put himself in the direct
line of fire from Bill’s machine gun.
And had that young man been minded to
use it the battle would have been over—almost
before it started.</p>

<p>Seeing his mistake almost immediately,
the bearded aviator broke his dive by zooming
upward. Again Dorothy’s plane dove
for his tail and right there he made his
second error.</p>

<p>Instead of gaining altitude and position
by making an Immelman turn, which consists
of a half-roll on the top of a loop, he
pulled back his stick sharply, simultaneously
giving the <i>Mystery Plane</i> full right
rudder. The result was an abrupt stall and
a fall off, and his amphibian emerged from
the resultant dive headed in the direction
from which he had first appeared.</p>

<p>Dorothy sent her bus spiralling downward,
while Bill simply nosed his Ryan
into a steeper climb. By the time the <i>Mystery
Plane</i> levelled off from its split-S turn
it had lost over a thousand feet. Granted
he was headed for home, if that had been
his intention; now he was placed in the
worst possible situation with regard to his
opponents. For instead of one, both planes
had attained positions above him.</p>

<p>For the next few minutes the man in the
smuggler’s plane did his best to out-maneuver
the elusive pair whose motors
roared above his head like giant bees attacking
an enemy. Never was he given a
chance to better his position or to gain altitude.
Every time he maneuvered to
place one of the planes within line of fire
from his machine gun, the other would effectually
block the move; the menacing
plane would sheer off at a tangent and its
partner, crowding down upon his tail,
would hurl forth a smoke bomb. By the
time he floundered through the cloud, his
antagonists would be back in their relative
positions, again, the one directly above his
tail plane, the other slightly behind him to
the right.</p>

<p>The bearded aviator knew that he was
being outclassed at every move, that gradually
they were forcing him down to a
point where he must land or crash.</p>

<p>Both Dorothy and Bill knew exactly
when the man in the plane below guessed
their purpose. For with a sudden burst of
speed he shot ahead, streaking in the direction
of North Stamford like a ghost in torment.</p>

<p>“We’ve got every advantage but one,”
mused Dorothy, widening her throttle in
pursuit. “He knows where he’s going—and
we don’t. He’s up to some trick, I’ll
bet.”</p>

<p>That her thoughts were prophetic was
made apparent almost immediately. By
shutting off his engine and by kicking his
rudder alternately right and left with comparatively
slow and heavy movements, the
smuggler pilot sent his plane’s nose swinging
from side to side. This evolution,
known as fish-tailing, he executed without
banking or dropping the nose to a steeper
angle. Its purpose is to cut down speed
and to do so as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The <i>Mystery Plane</i> slowed down as
though a brake had been applied, sideslipped
to the left over a line of trees and
leveled off above a field enclosed by a dilapidated
stone fence.</p>

<p>“Confound!” exclaimed Dorothy, with
a glance behind. “He’s going to land and
both Bill and I have overshot the field!”</p>

<p>Nose depressed below level, a lively flipper
turn to left brought <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
sharply round facing the field again with
its wings almost vertical. Immediate application
of up aileron and opposite rudder
quickly brought the amphibian to an
even keel once more. Then Dorothy
nosed over, went into a forward slip, recovered
and leveled off for a landing.</p>

<p>As the wheels of her plane touched the
ground, she saw the Ryan come to a stop
on the grass some yards to the right. Just
ahead and between them was the <i>Mystery
Plane</i>. It lay drunkenly over on one side,
resting on its twisted landing gear and a
crumpled lower wing section.</p>

<p>Dorothy stood up in her cockpit when
<i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> stopped rolling and saw
the smuggler-pilot vault the wall at the
far corner of the field and disappear into
a small wood. Bill was walking toward
the disabled amphibian. She got out of
her plane and hurried toward him.</p>

<p>“Pancaked!” she cried, pointing toward
the wreck as she came within speaking distance.</p>

<p>“You said it—” concurred Bill. “That
guy was in such a hurry he leveled off too
soon. Usually I don’t wish anybody hard
luck but that bird is the great exception.
Too bad he didn’t break a leg along with
his plane. Now he’s beat it and—”</p>

<p>“We are just about where we were before,”
she broke in.</p>

<p>“Not quite, Dorothy. The <i>Mystery
Plane</i> is out of commission.—I wonder
where we are?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere in the North Stamford
hills.”</p>

<p>“I know—but whose property are we
on?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the least idea.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see any houses around here. Did
you notice any as you came down?”</p>

<p>Dorothy shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>“My eyes were glued on this field,” she
admitted. “I was too busy trying to make
a landing myself to take in much of the
landscape. Wait a minute, though—seems
to me I caught a glimpse of the Castle just
before I put <i>Wispy</i> into that reverse control
turn. Yes, I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“The Castle?” Bill frowned. “What in
the cock-eyed world is that?”</p>

<p>“A castle, silly!”</p>

<p>“Make sense out of that, please.”</p>

<p>“Sorry. You’re usually trying to mystify
me—I just thought I’d turn the tables
for a change.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know—I’ll say I’m sorry or anything
else you want. Only please tell me
what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems that about fifteen or sixteen
years ago, somebody built a castle
about two or three miles from North Stamford
village. It’s less than five miles from
where we live. Not being up on medieval
architecture I can’t describe it properly,
but Dad says it is the kind that German robber
barons put up in the fourteenth century.
Anyway, the Castle is built of stone
with a steep, slate roof, which spouts pointed
turrets all over the place. I wouldn’t be
surprised if it had been built by a German—it
certainly looks as Heinie as sauerkraut!”</p>

<p>“Who lives there?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>“Nobody, now. During the war, Dad
told me, the place was suspected to be a
spy-hang-out or something like that. Anyway,
there was a lot of talk about it. What
became of the owner, whoever he is, I don’t
know. The place has been rented several
times during the past few years. It is quite
near the road. I drove past it just the other
day on my way to and from Nance Wilkins’
tea and the old dump looked quite
empty and forlorn.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that,” said Bill. “This
bearded guy may have been heading for
your Castle, but I doubt it. Fact is, he
probably decided to land at the first convenient
place when he found we were too
much for him, and decided to trust to his
legs for a getaway.”</p>

<p>Dorothy had been swinging her helmet
by its chin strap in an absent-minded manner.
Now she raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about it?”
she inquired. “We can’t try to break into
the Castle in broad daylight.”</p>

<p>“Hardly. And after our experience with
the bank gang, we’ll do no more snooping
around strange houses on our own. I am
going over to that little wood where our
friend ran to cover. Maybe I can find
some trace of him. You stay here with the
planes.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I go with you, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Because that smuggler may simply be
hiding in the woods in hopes that we’ll
come after him and that we’ll leave these
airbuses unguarded. Then when we’re
gone, he’ll come back here, grab one of
them and fly quietly home.”</p>

<p>“All right. I see.”</p>

<p>“Have you got a gun?”</p>

<p>“That small Colt you gave me is in
<i>Wispy’s</i> cockpit.”</p>

<p>“Get it and keep it on you—and if that
guy shows up, don’t be afraid to use it.”</p>

<p>Dorothy shook her head. “I never shot
at anybody in my life—”</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot <em>at</em> him—<em>shoot</em> him. You
might have to, you know.”</p>

<p>“But surely, Bill—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean for you to kill the guy.
Plunk him in the leg—disable him. If you
have any qualms about it, just remember
that machine gun in his bus here. The
man is as deadly as a copperhead and twice
as treacherous. Look out for him.”</p>

<p>“I will. But su-suppose you get into
trouble, Bill. How long do you want me
to wait here before I come after you?”</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” Bill was becoming impatient.
“I’m just going to try to find out
where that lad is headed. I won’t be gone
more than ten or fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But suppose you <em>don’t</em> come back
here!”</p>

<p>“Wait for half an hour. Then fly back
home and tell Dad what has happened.
He’ll know what to do. Don’t get nervous—I’ll
be all right. So long. See you in a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand, he ran across
the field and Dorothy saw him hurdle the
low wall and disappear between the trees
of the wood where the bearded aviator had
run to cover.</p>

<h2 id='ch16' class='c007'><i>Chapter XVI</i><br /><br />THE TUNNEL</h2>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy walked slowly back to <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i>
and climbed into the cockpit.
From the pilot’s seat she had an unobstructed
view of the field and the two other
airplanes. Overhead, fluffy wind clouds
began to appear from out of the northwest.
Near the stone wall, three small rabbits
sported in the sunshine; and presently a
groundhog waddled across the field.</p>

<p>She glanced at her watch. The hands
marked five past five. Bill had been gone
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>“And he told me not to get nervous,” she
thought indignantly. “This waiting
around is enough to set anybody off—I’ll
give him just ten minutes more!”</p>

<p>Dorothy counted those ten minutes quite
the longest she had ever experienced. Fifteen
minutes past five and still no Bill. He
had told her to wait half an hour and then
to fly home for help! But she was not the
sort of girl who permits herself to be
quietly wiped off the picture by an order
from a boy friend! She just wasn’t made
that way. Bill might be worried about the
safety of the planes; it was his safety that
worried her.</p>

<p>Determinedly she transferred the small
revolver from its holster to a pocket of the
jodhpurs she was wearing. Should she
pack a flash light, too? No need of that,
she decided. Figuring on daylight saving
time, it wouldn’t be dark until after eight
o’clock. Without more ado, she got out of
the plane and crossed the field toward the
wood.</p>

<p>After she had climbed the wall at the
spot where she had seen Bill disappear on
the trail of the bearded aviator, she came
upon a path. Narrow it was, and overgrown,
yet certainly a path, leading
through the trees at a diagonal from the
stone fence. Without hesitation, Dorothy
followed it.</p>

<p>She was soon certain that her idea of the
wood from the air was correct, and that it
covered no great acreage. Hurrying along
the winding footpath, she began to catch
glimpses of blue sky between the tree
trunks, and less than three hundred yards
from the wall she came into the open.</p>

<p>The trees ended at the edge of a broad
gully, apparently the bed of a shallow
stream in the spring or after a shower; but
now, except for a puddle or two, it was dry.
On the farther side, cows were grazing in
a meadow.</p>

<p>“Nice pastoral landscape,” she said
aloud. “Doesn’t look like much of a spot
for mischief—”</p>

<p>In spite of her bravado, Dorothy felt a
lump in her throat. If Bill were missing,
too, and she could not find him....</p>

<p>The pasture sloped gently upward over
a hill, perhaps a quarter of a mile away.
And on the horizon above the hilltop, the
Castle reared its pointed turrets skyward.
For a little while she watched the huge,
grey pile of stone, whose narrow leaded
windows reflecting the late afternoon sun,
winked at her with many mocking eyes.
What a dreary-looking place it was, she
thought. Ugly and forbidding, it was entirely
out of place in this New England
countryside. The Castle seemed utterly
deserted. It probably was. At least the
path ended at the gully; there was no sign
of it across the meadow.</p>

<p>Where was the bearded aviator—and
above all, where was Bill?</p>

<p>“Bill distinctly said he would not snoop
around the Castle,” she thought. “I wonder
if he really came this far?”</p>

<p>So eager had she been to reach the edge
of the wood that she had paid very little attention
to the ground she was covering.
As this new thought struck her, she turned
and gazed back over the way she had come.
There were her own footprints clearly defined
in the damp earth—but there was no
sign that either Bill or the smuggler had
passed that way.</p>

<p>Back along the path she trudged, walking
slowly this time.</p>

<p>“I’m a pretty poor woodsman,” she told
herself. “They must have turned off somewhere.”</p>

<p>Her eyes searched the soft earth of the
narrow trail and the thick bushes through
which it wandered. But it was not until
she had gone half way back to the stone
wall that she discovered traces of footprints.
And where the prints left the path,
a ragged remnant of a handkerchief swung
from a twig near the ground.</p>

<p>“There!” she pounced upon it joyfully.
“How could I have been so stupid as to
miss it—I might have known!”</p>

<p>The initials, “W. B.” embroidered in
one corner of the dirty fragment of linen
banished any doubt she may have had as
to its ownership. Leaving it tied to the
bush, she struck into the wood.</p>

<p>Now that she was intent upon her stalking,
there was no mistaking the trail left by
the other two. A broken twig, heel marks
on the soft mold, a trampled patch of moss;
all these signs bespoke a hasty passage
through the brush.</p>

<p>She had not gone far, when suddenly in
a clearing she came upon the end of the
trail. The earth here was bare of undergrowth
and sloped sharply down into a
marshy ravine. In the center of the little
clearing a pile of brush was heaped with
dead grass and rubbish,—tin cans, old
shoes, automobile fenders, rusty bed-springs,
boxes and weathered newspapers.</p>

<p>For a moment Dorothy stared at the rubbish
dump. Then she noticed footprints
circling the heap and followed them down
to the ravine. Here, as if to bulwark the
miscellaneous junk and to keep it from
sliding, was a buttress of boxes and barrels.</p>

<p>Dorothy got down on her knees and
examined these carefully. At the very bottom,
almost on a level with the tussocky surface
of the marsh, a barrel lay on its side,
its depth leading inward. A sudden inspiration
made her pull a long stick from
the pile and run it into the barrel. She
gave a little gurgle of astonishment. The
barrel had no bottom.</p>

<p>Still on her knees she peered inside. Just
beyond the rim lay a scrap of paper. She
picked it up and scrawled upon it were the
words “This way”....</p>

<p>“Another message!” she whispered jubilantly.</p>

<p>She tried to move the barrel but found
that it was securely nailed to the bulwark
of packing-cases. The soft earth about its
mouth was heavily marked with footprints.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no doubt about it now—‘this
way’—” she murmured and without
further waste of time wormed her way into
the barrel.</p>

<p>As she crawled through the other end,
she found herself in a narrow tunnel. The
daylight appearing through its ingenious
entrance was strong enough to show her
that the rubbish had been built over a frame
of two-by-fours and chickenwire, which
formed the roof and sides of the tunnel under
the dump.</p>

<p>Dorothy got to her feet. A short distance
ahead the tunnel led straight into the
high ground over which she had come
from the wood path. Here the sides were
timbered with stout posts, and ceiled with
cross beams to prevent the earthen roof
from falling.</p>

<p>“Gee, if this isn’t like Alice in Wonderland!
Why, I might meet the White Rabbit
any minute now.” She giggled, then
shivered as she remembered why she was
there.</p>

<p>For a moment she considered returning
to the plane for her flash light, but decided
it would take too much precious time, and
passed on cautiously, stopping now and
then to listen. She could hear nothing but
the squashy sound of her footsteps on the
marshy floor of the tunnel.</p>

<p>After proceeding about fifteen feet, the
dark passage turned slightly in its course.
Just beyond the turn, as Dorothy was groping
to find which way it led, her hands
touched a wooden surface. This proved
to be a heavy door, standing partly open.
As she shoved it back with her shoulder,
she tripped over a heavy object which lay
across the sill. Dorothy reached down in
the darkness and picked up a crowbar.</p>

<p>She advanced, dragging the crowbar
after her. The floor of the passage at this
point began to slope up hill. But after a
few paces ahead, she found it went abruptly
downward at a considerable angle, took a
sharp turn to the right, then began to slope
gently upward again.</p>

<p>By this time she had lost all sense of direction.
She progressed slowly, feeling
along the wall with her left hand, resting it
on one timber until she had advanced half
way to where she supposed the next would
be. In this manner she crept on for nearly
a quarter of a mile without meeting any
obstruction. The air, though cold and lifeless,
was breathable; but the darkness and
the horrid feeling of being shut in began to
get on her nerves. Once more she stopped
to listen. Absolute stillness. Dorothy
could hear nothing but the beating of her
heart as she strained her eyes to pierce the
black passage. She seemed completely
shut off from everything on earth.</p>

<p>Feeling that inaction was even more unbearable
than running head-on into danger,
she recommenced her slow advance.
Presently, she came to a place where the
tunnel widened out. Here, even with outstretched
arms, she could not reach both
walls at once.</p>

<p>As she swung to follow the left hand
wall, her right arm struck a free timber
which seemed to have no connection with
either side of the passage. From this she
deduced that she was now in a sort of subterranean
chamber, and that this free post
was one of the supports of its roof. Continuing
along the left wall, with her right arm
outstretched, she soon reached another
post. The heavy crowbar which she was
endeavoring to carry at arm’s length,
struck against the base of the upright and
made a loud, cavernous sound.</p>

<p>“Bloomp!”</p>

<p>Dorothy was prepared for the next timber,
some three feet farther on. She took
the crowbar in her left hand and extended
her right to grasp the post, with the intention
to discover the size of the chamber.</p>

<p>Suddenly she recoiled in horror. She
could feel a chill rush up and down her
spine. For she had touched, not the splintered
wood of the post, but, unmistakably,
human flesh.</p>

<p>Dodging quickly to one side, she
dropped the crowbar and drew her revolver.
Holding it straight before her, ready
to fire at the first sign of a hostile advance,
she listened breathlessly.</p>

<p>To her amazement, there was no sound;
not the slightest indication of movement
in the awful darkness. She supposed the
enemy must be maneuvering to take her
from some unexpected quarter. But she
could not understand how it could be managed
in that inky blackness without giving
her some audible sign.</p>

<p>Feeling that she must have something
firmer than mere space behind her,
Dorothy retreated, keeping her pistol
leveled. With her left hand she groped behind
her and when she felt the solid timber,
she leaned back against it, waiting.</p>

<p>Seconds dragged like hours and still
there was no sound. Gradually, Dorothy’s
nerves were beginning to quiet down.</p>

<p>“Well, this is darned queer,” she
thought, “maybe that person is making
tracks out of here. I can’t just stand still
and do nothing, anyway.”</p>

<p>She began to move forward very cautiously.
When she had covered ten short
paces, she stopped and listened again. Absolute
stillness everywhere, stillness pervaded
by the strange, dank smell of unsunned
earth and the musty rot of roots
and wood.</p>

<p>But this time Dorothy fancied she could
hear a faint, very faint sound of breathing.
At first she thought it was her own, reechoing
from the walls of the dark cavern.
Then she held her breath and listened once
more. <em>There</em> was some one else in this subterranean
chamber.</p>

<p>“Well, here goes,” she said with closed
lips. “It’s now or never. I can’t stand
this much longer!”</p>

<p>But she had only taken a single step
when the same chill of horror and fright
raced over her again. Her revolver
muzzle had touched something apparently
alive and yielding, the clothed body of
someone who stood motionless as before.</p>

<p>“Hold it! hold it!” she cried, her teeth
chattering. “Don’t move or I’ll plug you!”</p>

<p>With her gun firmly pressed against the
body, she raised her other arm to ward off
any blow that might be directed against
her. As she did so, it became evident that
the body still had not moved, that the breath
was coming regularly and faintly, but
there was no stir of limbs, no shift of muscle
or of weight.</p>

<p>Such mysterious behavior filled
Dorothy with terror. She bit her lips and
dug the mouth of her Colt forward into
the body.</p>

<p>“Stick ’em up—do you hear? Over your
head!” she said viciously between her
teeth.</p>

<p>The figure remained motionless and as
silent as before. Dorothy felt her heart
beats mount to a violent thunder. She felt
she could stand the strain no longer.</p>

<p>Still holding her pistol against the flesh
of this mysterious being, she lowered her
arm from her forehead and reached slowly
forward. She touched something. Her
whole body was convulsed with horror, anguish
and surprise.</p>

<p>Her trembling fingers had descended
upon the smooth, cool softness of a leather
helmet. They slipped, cold and damp,
from the helmet to the face and over the
warm cheek.</p>

<p>In that moment everything was changed.
Now Dorothy understood why the figure
was motionless and quiet. She touched a
fold of cloth that bound the mouth and
slipping her hand to the shoulder, she felt
a twist of thin rope.</p>

<p>She slipped the pistol into her belt without
hesitation. Bill always carried several
packets of matches in his pockets. She
found one and struck a light.</p>

<p>When the little puff of smoke and the
obscuring haze of the first flash settled
down to a fitful flame, Dorothy got a
glimpse of her friend. He was gagged
and bound to one of the upright supports.
His eyes were closed and his head drooped
to one side.</p>

<p>In less than a second Dorothy had flung
away the match and was cutting the young
fellow’s bonds with her knife, groping for
them in the dark and supporting his released
body against her own as she worked.
At last she was able to lift him out of the
loosened loop that had held his feet and
stepping back, laid him on the earthen
floor.</p>

<p>Then she knelt beside him, rubbing his
wrists and cheeks with her grimy palms.
For some minutes her ministrations seemed
of no avail. But presently, under her fingers
she felt his head move. At first she
could only catch groans and sighs. Then,
as consciousness began to assert itself, Bill
raised his head a little and said faintly:</p>

<p>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s me—Dorothy.”</p>

<p>She lifted his head into her lap. As she
did so Bill gave a start and struggled feebly.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” he muttered. “Let me
alone!”</p>

<p>“Just keep quiet, Bill,” she soothed.
“You’ll be better soon.”</p>

<p>Bill lay back in her arms and was still.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked again and this
time in a firmer voice.</p>

<p>“It’s Dorothy, your pardner!”</p>

<p>“Dorothy? Thank Heaven for that.”
He caught at her hand and squeezed it.
“We’re in the tunnel, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes—where it widens out into a kind
of room.”</p>

<p>“I remember now—that guy slugged me
when I was making for the candle on the
table over there.”</p>

<p>“Who slugged you? The bearded aviator?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I was coming along,
lighting matches to see by when he stepped
from behind one of the uprights—and
that’s all I remember. Knocked me out, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did! You’ve a bump on
your head like an egg. The helmet probably
saved your life. Feel pretty rotten,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You said it! Dizzy as blazes—and my
head’s as sore as a boil. But I guess I’ll be
all right in a minute if I can just lie still.
Do you mind?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, silly. Take your time.
I suppose you followed the footprints to
the barrel, like I did.”</p>

<p>“Yep. But how come you went after
me?” he chuckled. “I thought the idea
was to beat it home in the plane.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bill, I just couldn’t!”</p>

<p>Bill sat up. “Well, I suppose I was
crazy to ever think you would—but I honestly
didn’t think I’d get into such close
quarters with that fellow. As it is, I’m
mighty glad you didn’t take my fool suggestion,”
he admitted. “Where would I
be now, if you hadn’t shown up? By the
taste in my mouth and the feel of my wrists,
that galoot must have tied me up and
gagged me!”</p>

<p>“He did that. You were bound to an
upright. Have you any idea where this
tunnel comes out?”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars to counterfeit two-cent
piece, your Castle is the answer to that
question,” he said, and lit a match. “Oh,
there’s the table, Dorothy. Do you mind
lighting that candle? I’m too dizzy to
stand up yet or—”</p>

<p>He stopped short and Dorothy saw his
eyes widen in startled surprise.</p>

<p>“<em>Look out!</em>” he yelled and the match
went out.</p>

<p>Dorothy felt a hand grip the back of her
neck and immediately afterward its fellow
clutched her throat. In a fierce frenzy of
terror, she shot to her feet, gasping and
choking and flinging her arms wildly backwards
as she rose.</p>

<h2 id='ch17' class='c007'><i>Chapter XVII</i><br /><br />“THE TOMBS”</h2>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy’s vigorous motion forced her
assailant to relax his grip upon her throat,
and as she felt his weight upon her shoulders,
she lunged down and backward.
There was a dull, cracking thud, and the
sound of a body falling. The back of her
head struck one of the timbers that supported
the ceiling of the tunnel. The place
seemed to whirl round and round and glittering
sparks danced before her eyes.
When this sensation ceased, Dorothy
leaned back against the post into which she
had flung herself in her apparently successful
effort to shake off her opponent.</p>

<p>With the realization that the attack had
halted and that her assailant had either
made his escape or was incapacitated, she
fumbled in her pocket for a match.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Dorothy?” Bill’s voice
called from the dark void.</p>

<p>“Right here, old thing—by the wall.”</p>

<p>She struck a light.</p>

<p>“All right?”</p>

<p>He looked pale and shaken in the flicker
of the tiny flame. She saw that he grasped
the crowbar.</p>

<p>“A bit woozy,” she replied, and lit the
candle on the table. “Cracked my head
on a beam or something.”</p>

<p>“That bearded guy didn’t hurt you?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t get a chance. Which way do
you think he went?”</p>

<p>Bill laughed softly. “You put him out
of business. Look!”</p>

<p>He pointed toward an upright and
Dorothy saw a crumpled figure lying huddled
at the base of the post.</p>

<p>“Goodness! You don’t think I’ve finished
him?” she breathed in horrified
alarm.</p>

<p>“No such luck,” he affirmed callously
and bent over the man’s body. “Sit down
until you feel better. This chap is only
stunned. I’ll take care of him.”</p>

<p>Dorothy stumbled over to the table.
Near-by was a chair. She dropped into it.</p>

<p>“He bumped his skull on this post,” Bill
went on. “No great damage, I guess.
Funny—whenever there’s a rough-house
in the dark, somebody invariably gets a
broken head. The three of us are even
now.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with him?”
Her dizziness was passing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll give him as good as he gave me,
and lash him to this upright.”</p>

<p>He busied himself tying up the unconscious
smuggler. When he had finished,
he looked up and beckoned to Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Come over here. He’s plenty secure
now. This rope held me, I guess it’ll hold
him.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>“Find out who this chap really is.”</p>

<p>His fingers peeled off the false beard
and Dorothy cried out in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tracey!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“It’s Tracey, all right!”</p>

<p>“But who’d have thought that sleek
pussy cat was mixed up in this? Aren’t
you surprised, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Not very. When his car had the breakdown
this morning I began to suspect.
The whole thing was too darn opportune.
He was part of their system of watchers,
of course. Probably wanted to find out
how we’d taken their warning.”</p>

<p>“But surely Mr. Holloway can have
nothing to do with it! He’s such a sweet
old man.”</p>

<p>Billy transferred two revolvers from
Tracey’s belt to his own.</p>

<p>“If you want my candid opinion,” he
said, “Old Holloway is the leader and
brains of the gang. Only it’s going to be
the dickens and all to prove it in a court of
law.”</p>

<p>Dorothy stared at him incredulously.
“Why, Bill—are you <em>sure</em>?”</p>

<p>“Why not? He’s just a double-dealer,
that’s all. That wise old bird is certain to
have a flock of cast iron alibis up his sleeve.
He must have made more than enough
money out of this diamond smuggling to
keep Tracey’s mouth shut—and the
mouths of any others who may be corralled.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hunch,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I want to chew it over a bit.
Let’s go back now and get help.”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to do. I’m going on to
the Castle and surprise whoever’s there. I
don’t think they have a suspicion of what
has happened down here. Tracey never
got that far, I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can take it from me that
you’re not going alone. I’m coming with
you.”</p>

<p>Bill hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps that’s the best way, after
all,” he admitted at last. “It will take some
time to get the proper people over here—and
by then somebody in the Castle might
spot the crumpled plane and start to investigate.
Time’s more than money now—let’s
go.”</p>

<p>“But do you think you can make it?”</p>

<p>“Can do,” he said grimly. “I’ve got a
sweet headache, but it might be worse.
How about you?”</p>

<p>“Ditto,” she smiled. “Are you going
to drag that heavy crowbar?”</p>

<p>“Think it might be wise. Lucky I
found it by that camouflaged dump. I had
to bash the lock of the door to the main
tunnel with it. And there may be another
door farther along.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take the candle,” she said.
With the light held well over her head, she
followed him out of the chamber.</p>

<p>The tunnel from here on was concreted,
walls, roof and floor. Passing quickly
along for possibly a hundred yards, they
approached a steep flight of steps. At the
top they found a closed door. Bill turned
the handle and it swung inward.</p>

<p>“Guess I won’t need this any more,” he
said and braced the door open with the
crowbar. “If they’re too many for us, we
may have to leave in a hurry. Just as well
to keep the way clear.”</p>

<p>By the feeble light of the candle they saw
that they stood in a small whitewashed cellar.
Leading off this to the left, was an
open corridor, and from some distance
down this passage came the glow of electric
light. A large safe, painted white, was
built into a corner of the cellar wall.</p>

<p>At a nod from Bill, Dorothy blew out
the light and placed the candlestick on the
stone floor. Then as she straightened up
he brought his lips close to her ear.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that’s where they keep the loot!
Follow me, and hold your gun handy.”</p>

<p>One after the other, on tiptoe, the pair
crept across the cellar, their rubber-soled
shoes making not the slightest sound.
When they came to the corridor, Bill slackened
his pace but continued to stalk steadily
forward. On their left the whitewashed
wall led straight on in an unbroken line.
In the right wall, they saw the iron grills
of cells. They passed the first, which was
dark, and evidently empty. From the second
came the glow of light.</p>

<p>Bill turned and placed a finger on his
lips. Then he got down on his hands and
knees and crawled forward to the door.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” Dorothy heard him
gasp. “So that’s where they had you!”</p>

<p>He stood up and she hurried toward him.</p>

<p>“<em>Terry!</em>”</p>

<p>Her cry was one of absolute amazement.
Through the grating she saw her long lost
friend, starting up from his cot where he
had been reading when Bill’s exclamation
caused him to look around. Terry advanced
to the door and greeted them.</p>

<p>“Well, by all that’s wonderful! Dorothy!
Bill Bolton! What—”</p>

<p>“Are you all right? You’re not hurt or
anything?” Dorothy’s excited whisper
broke in upon his incoherent surprise.</p>

<p>“No, I’m safe and sound, except that I’m
pretty tired of reading—cooped up in this
hole. But say, how did you two manage
to get down here?”</p>

<p>“Through the tunnel,” replied Bill with
a grin.</p>

<p>“Gee, is there a tunnel, too? Never
heard of it. How about that lad Peters and
the others—you didn’t see them?”</p>

<p>“No, we came through the cellar. Have
you any idea where they are?”</p>

<p>“Upstairs, probably—in the house—playing
cards. Since Peters came here a
few days ago he’s been bringing me my
grub. He’s quite chatty; likes to boast
about how he trims those others at poker.”</p>

<p>“How many men are there altogether,
do you know?” asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen more than three at a
time, unless you count their be-whiskered
pilot I mixed it up with at the beach club.
Remember him, Dorothy? But he doesn’t
come around much, so Peters says. He
doesn’t like him—thinks he’s high-hat.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s out of the picture, now,” declared
Bill. “We got him in the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and Terry, do you know that he
is Mr. Tracey?” Dorothy could not contain
the exciting news any longer.</p>

<p>“Great grief! You don’t say so! I
never could stand that fellow—didn’t think
he had sense enough to come in out of the
rain. But then, you never can tell which
way a cat will jump.” He stepped closer
to the grill and looked anxiously from Bill
to Dorothy. “Say, do you think you two
could find a way of getting me out of
here?”</p>

<p>“We left a grand crowbar in the cellar!
Don’t you think we could bash the lock
with it, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Might pry it open. But I’m afraid the
noise would give us away—”</p>

<p>“Not a chance of that—if you mean it
might disturb the poker players,” Terry interrupted.
“There’s a perfect whale of a
sound proof door at the head of the stairs.
I was brought down that way. They always
keep it shut.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Bill hurried off to get the crowbar.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about, Dorothy?” asked
Terry. “All I know is that these lads held
up my car the night of the Sillies. Some
bird in a mask drew a gun on me—my eyes
were bandaged and I was popped into another
bus and brought over here. Where
am I, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re in that old stone Castle—near
North Stamford. This is a diamond
smuggling gang we’re up against. The
local and the state police, not to mention
Secret Service agents, have been scouring
the country for you. Wait till you see the
newspapers! You’re nationally famous!
But your mother and father and the rest of
us have been terribly worried.”</p>

<p>Terry nodded. “I’ve been thinking of
that,” he replied. “But diamond smugglers,
eh! No wonder—” he whistled
softly. “You’ve no idea what it was like
to be caged up here—thinking of the family
and how terrible it was for them—not
knowing why I was here, or if I’d ever be
set free. Yet they’ve not tried any rough
stuff. Gave me plenty of books and magazines,
and enough decent food, thank
goodness!”</p>

<p>Bill reappeared, carrying the bar.</p>

<p>“Now get back from the door, Terry,”
he cautioned. “I’m going to have a go at
it with this.”</p>

<p>He placed the end of the crowbar
through the grating and behind the steel
disk which held the lock. Then he shoved
it forward and sideways until that end was
jammed between the inner edge of the door
and the frame.</p>

<p>“Lend me a hand, please, Dorothy, and
we’ll see what a bit of leverage will do.”</p>

<p>Together they seized the crowbar and
pulled. There was a sharp snap and the
door flew open.</p>

<p>“Good enough!” cried Terry. He
sprang into the corridor and grasped their
hands.</p>

<p>“You said it,” laughed Bill. “That’s the
second time this bar has come in handy
since we started this job. If we ever get
out of here I’m going to keep it as a souvenir.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the diamonds,” Dorothy added
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“What’s on deck now?” inquired Terry.</p>

<p>Bill grew suddenly serious.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where they keep
themselves above?”</p>

<p>“It’s ten to one they’ll be playing poker
in the kitchen. They’ve nothing else to
do now, except to feed me—or so Peters
says.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the kitchen? I mean, how do
we get to it from here?”</p>

<p>“It’s along this passage and up the staircase
at the end. The door at the top—the
sound proof one—opens into the kitchen.”</p>

<p>Bill handed Terry a gun. “Don’t be
afraid to use it,” he commanded. “They
won’t hesitate to shoot if they get a chance.”</p>

<p>Terry looked at him in great disdain.
“Say, just because I appear to be my cheerful
self and so on, don’t get the idea that
I’ve enjoyed this rest cure. All I’ve been
thinking about for days—and nights too—is
the chance to get even with them. Now
I have it.” He patted the revolver.</p>

<p>“O.K. then, come along, both of you.”</p>

<p>It was but a step to the turn in the passage.
Directly ahead lay a steep flight of
stairs. And at the top was the silent menace
of the closed door.</p>

<h2 id='ch18' class='c007'><i>Chapter XVIII</i><br /><br />THE FLAGS</h2>

<p class='c006'>“Do you think it will be unlocked?” Bill
dropped his voice to a whisper. The three
were standing on the landing at the head of
the stairs, facing the door.</p>

<p>“Sure to be,” returned Terry. “That
is, if we can take friend Peters’ word for
it. He spilled all this dope when he’d had
an argument with the rest of the gang.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go—” said Bill. “You stand
to one side, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” With a twist of the handle,
that young lady threw the door wide and
jumped into the room.</p>

<p>“Hands up! Stick ’em up!” she cried.</p>

<p>Two of the three men seated at the table
complied at once with her command.
Their hands shot above their heads with
the rapidity of lightning. The third
reached for a revolver that lay amongst the
scattered cards.</p>

<p>“<em>Bang!</em>”</p>

<p>The man gave a cry of pain and caught
at his shattered wrist with his other hand.</p>

<p>Startled by the sudden detonation just
behind her, Dorothy almost dropped her
gun.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone it!” Terry seemed annoyed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Bill still covered
the men.</p>

<p>“Matter enough! Too much rest cure,
I guess. Forgot to remove the safety catch
on this gat you gave me. Lucky you fired
when you did.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind that now,” Bill’s
words were crisp and to the point. “Grab
that clothesline and tie their hands behind
their backs. That’s right! Dorothy, will
you give first aid to that fellow’s wrist? I’ll
see that they don’t play any tricks.”</p>

<p>After securing the men, Terry searched
their clothes and produced two revolvers
and a wicked looking knife. He also took
a ring of keys from Peters.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed that gentleman. “If
it ain’t the girl what blame near kicked me
teeth out I’ll eat me bloomin’ hat!”</p>

<p>“You’ll eat skilly in Wethersfield Prison,
or Atlanta, before you get through,” Terry
promised. “Shake a leg—both of you.
Down to the cells for yours. Did you ever
realize what a swell difference there is between
the titles of jailer and prisoner?
March!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” Dorothy cut in. “I’ll
help you take this man along, too. I’ve
done all I can for him. It’s a clean hole
through his wrist. Bone’s broken but the
bullet missed the artery. He might be
worse off.”</p>

<p>Bill spoke from the doorway that led into
the rest of the house. “While you’re
gone I’ll search this place for any other
members that might otherwise be overlooked!”</p>

<p>After housing the smugglers in cells,
Dorothy and Terry returned to the kitchen
and were surprised to find Bill speaking
over the telephone.</p>

<p>“And that’s that, Dad,” they heard him
say. “Spread the good tidings in proper
places and make it snappy, please. Bye-bye!”</p>

<p>He placed the receiver on its hook.</p>

<p>“I guess you got that,” he smiled. “Dad
will phone the police and Washington.
Then he’s driving over here with Frank.
And he will also let Mr. Walters and your
father know, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Fine—I’m glad he thought of that!”
Dorothy laughed in excited approval.</p>

<p>“Didn’t take you long to search the
place,” said Terry.</p>

<p>“No—only a few rooms on this floor are
being used. The staircase is thick with
dust. Nobody up there—no footprints.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to do now?”</p>

<p>“We’ll wait for Dad, of course,” said
Bill, “and then Dorothy and I can fly our
respective planes home. How about it,
pal? Feel able to do that?”</p>

<p>Dorothy lifted her eyebrows in derision.
“Well, I should hope so! I suppose I do
look pretty frazzled—but you don’t seem
in the best condition yourself. However—I’ve
another plan.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>Terry had taken over the phone and was
talking in low tones to his mother.</p>

<p>“Do you remember I told you I had a
hunch, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. What about it?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to follow my hunch.”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll start out of this house—by
the front door this time, if you please—then
across the meadow and through the
wood to the field where our planes are
parked.”</p>

<p>“And—?”</p>

<p>“And then you’re going to get into the
rear cockpit of <i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> and take
a little hop with me.”</p>

<p>Bill looked surprised. “What about my
Ryan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank can pilot her home.”</p>

<p>“Yes? And then where are we going?”</p>

<p>“That’s my secret. Tell Terry, and come
along now. We’re in a hurry, even if you
don’t know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m evidently not supposed to
know anything of this new mystery!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be stuffy! Come on, now. This
is serious, Bill, really, I’m not leading you
on a wild goose chase, I promise you.”</p>

<p>“Humph! It must be hot stuff—not!”</p>

<p>Dorothy made a face at him. “I want to
tell you it’s the hottest stuff of the whole
business. And I just want you to be in at
the finish, don’t you see, stupid?”</p>

<p>“All right. As you insist—”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Of course I do. And
when we’ve done this thing up brown, I’ll
cart you back home to dinner—and if you
are very good you can sit next to me!”</p>

<p>Bill grinned. “You may be New England
Yankee, but that line of blarney you
hand out spells Ireland in capital letters!
Come on then, we’ll leave Terry to guard
the fort.”</p>

<p>After they had put that young man wise
to their plans, the two left the Castle. They
were both pretty nearly exhausted after
their experiences in the tunnel, but the success
of their adventure was elating, and
more than made up for its bad effects.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the field just where we left
it,” announced Bill as he helped Dorothy
over the stone fence. “And there’s that
<i>Willy</i> plane of yours, too. Whither away?”</p>

<p>“Hop in and you’ll see.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Bill looked down
from his seat in the rear cockpit and saw
that she was going to land near the tennis
courts in the broad parking space behind
the cabanas at the beach club. The members
had become used to seeing her land
<i>Will-o’-the-Wisp</i> on the club grounds.
Their descent therefore caused little or no
notice. The plane stopped rolling and a
man in the club uniform of a beach attendant
ran up.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jeffries,” waved Bill. “I thought
you might be here. How are things?”</p>

<p>“We caught Donovan and Charlie
Myers over at Babylon. But they’re small
fry. Anything new, Bolton?”</p>

<p>Bill got out of the plane and helped
Dorothy to descend.</p>

<p>“I should say there is! Tell you about
it in a minute. Dorothy, let me present
Mr. Arthur Jeffries, one of the very big
men of the United States Secret Service.
Arthur, this is the famous Dorothy
Dixon!”</p>

<p>Arthur Jeffries said some polite things
which caused Dorothy to blush modestly,
and in a few pithy sentences Bill told the
story of their afternoon.</p>

<p>“So you see, old man,” he ended. “You
won’t have to wait around this club any
longer disguised as a goldfish or what
have you—because the bearded aviator
won’t fly the <i>Mystery Plane</i> over here any
more—that is to say—not for twenty years
or so at the soonest.”</p>

<p>“He’ll get all that or more,” Jeffries
commented crisply. “But the man he
worked for—sunning himself over there
on the sand—old Holloway, I mean—he’s
the nigger in the woodpile! The boss of
this gang of diamond smugglers—but I
can’t arrest him on that evidence!”</p>

<p>Dorothy made an eager gesture. “Will
you come with me—I want to show you
two something. We’ll go around the far
side of that big cabana on the end of the
boardwalk. We’re going inside.”</p>

<p>“Holloway’s bath house?” This from
Bill.</p>

<p>“Exactly. I don’t want him to see us,
though, so be careful.”</p>

<p>The three rounded the gaily painted cottage
and ducking under the red and black
striped awning, entered the front room
which was fitted out with the usual wicker
furniture and bright rugs.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he keeps them,”
Dorothy murmured to herself. “Ah—this
looks like it!”</p>

<p>She lifted the hinged lid of a handsome
sea chest and pulled forth a dozen or more
colored flags.</p>

<p>“By jove! The goods!” cried Bill.
“How did you ever guess it, Dot?”</p>

<p>Dorothy was so pleased by her find that
she passed over his use of the despised diminutive.</p>

<p>“I just happened to remember that he
generally decked out his cabana with a
flock of these things. And though the club
runs up flags on special occasions, Mr.
Holloway did it nearly every afternoon.
It came to me when you pulled off Tracey’s
beard back there in the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Arthur Jeffries.
“Holloway would get word in New York
at his office, probably, when a liner carrying
contraband was expected off Fire Island
light. Then he’d come out here and
signal the time to Tracey in his airplane,
by means of these flags. I’ll bet the old
boy never went near that Castle. Some
alibi! He and Tracey probably never saw
each other from the time he went to the
city in the morning until he came home for
dinner at night.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to arrest him now?” she
asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>“As soon as I can get out on the beach.
I’ll do it as quietly as possible, of course.
No use in causing a disturbance with his
friends around. So long, Bill. Glad to
have met you, Miss Dixon—and many
thanks. See you both later on.”</p>

<p>They left the cabana with him, but
turned back toward the plane as he went
down the beach.</p>

<p>“That ties it, I guess,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“It certainly does!” agreed Bill.</p>

<p>“Now—didn’t I tell you it would be hot
stuff?”</p>

<p>He looked at her and they both burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“And the best of it is that the government
will probably pin a medal on you for
it!” he declared.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bill! Do you really think that?”</p>

<p>Bill grinned at her excitement. “You
get into that plane and take me home to
dinner. That was the bargain, and I’m
famished!”</p>

<p>“Dinner!” exclaimed Dorothy in disgust.
“My word! We’ve caught those diamond
smugglers when the whole of the
Secret Service couldn’t do it—and all you
think of is food! Gee, I’m glad I’m not a
mere man. Hop aboard. I’ll give her the
gun and fly you home to your dinner.”</p>
